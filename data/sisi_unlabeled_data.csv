1015," Toronto woman sues Rogers after her affair is exposed

"" 

A Toronto woman says the billing practices of Rogers Wireless Inc. led to her husband discovering her extramarital affair.

Now the woman, whose husband walked out, is suing the communications giant for $600,000 for alleged invasion of privacy and breach of contract, the results of which she says have ruined her life.

In 2007, Gabriella Nagy had a cellphone account with Rogers which sent the monthly bill to her home address in her maiden name. Her husband was the account holder for the family's cable TV service at the same address. Around June 4, 2007, he called Rogers to add internet and home phone.

The following month, Rogers mailed a ?global? invoice for all of its services to the matrimonial home that included an itemized bill for Nagy's cellular service, according to the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

When Nagy?s husband opened the Rogers invoice, he saw several hour-long phone calls to a single phone number.

?Nobody does business this way and he's not stupid,? says Nagy, who is in her 30s. He called the number, spoke to the ?third party? who confirmed the affair, which had lasted only a few weeks, Nagy told the *Star*.

?My husband didn't tell me that's how he found out, he just left.?

&#x200B;

"" 

Nagy is deeply embarrassed and ashamed about what happened. ?It was a mistake,? she said of the affair. ?But I didn?t deserve to lose my life over it.?

After her husband left her and their two children, ages 6 and 7, she was so distraught her work performance suffered and she lost her job as an apartment rental agent that had paid her almost $100,000 until she was let go in Oct. 10, 2007. ?The plaintiff wept uncontrollably at her workplace . . . and became incapable of performing her employment duties,? reads the statement of claim. Nagy says the employer was aware of the situation and that she was receiving medical attention.

Nagy?s lawyer, Edward Tonello, says this case is unprecedented in Canada.""

He has a very attractive face and is slim and tall. He was always popular with women and I think he never saw their negative side.

Unfortunately, he has a very weak personality. He always conforms to his current girlfriend. When he was dating a Christian girl, he was also a devout believer. His fiancee is now a radical feminist - so he's an atheist and also a radical feminist.

The woman is openly man-hating. She is spouting all the stereotypical crap about the wage gap, female oppression, welcoming of immigrants and so on. She literally told me to stop working out because I'm muscular enough already, even though I'm nothing special (no humblebrag intended). Guess I was a bad influence on her victim... She takes issue when we discuss female beauty but she was openly ogling a ripped black dude when we were in the baths a while ago (in the very presence of her fiancee). She is the embodiment of the cancerous 3rd wave feminist.

And now my best friend is going to swear before the law that they'll be together forever and link assets.

There's nothing to be done. I've been trying to redpill the guy for years but he just doesn't have the intestinal fortitude. I guess all there's left now is saving space on the couch for him to sleep on after his divorce-rape.

Jesus Christ, are these people out of their minds? they're all (without even one exception) trying to justify the BAN ON PATERNITY TEST in France. 
what's wrong with these people? 
they turn evey shit into ""philosophical"" argument, shits like: ""family is not parallel to genetics"" and bullshits like ""you don't necessarily have to give your sperms to become a father"" and shits like that.

this literally has one simple message for French women: ""as long as you're not banging that arab immigrant from Syria and are only fooling around with white dudes, you're good to go since your hubby can't determine whether it's his child or the chad next door.""

even if you take a test OUTSIDE France, you're still going to be put in jail for 1 YEAR and 15,000 ? fined just because you doubted your wife's infidelity.

it's like they pass a law in USA that will send you to jail if ever hired a prostitute in Thailand, seems ridiculous, but since prostitution is illegal in USA, you must go to jail anyway. thank God they haven't passed it yet.

But as time has gone on, I've realised that all women are the same, and all women are abominable and irredeemable. 

I knew all of this subconsciously, but I still fought against it, because I was still under the blue pill romanticized mindset of love and commitment. But now my patience and tolerance for women has completely run out. My whole life, women have done nothing but make my life miserable. My mum was abusive, the girls at my school used to bully me, and I have never had a long term relationship with a female. And to be totally honest, I don't want to anymore. I just don't care anymore. I have no love for women whatsoever. I have decided to go full MGTOW monk for the rest of my life.

Divorce laws don?t actually favor women.  

What they do favor is the LOWER EARNER. 

Now....because virtually no woman will be with a man that makes less than they do, the law de facto favors women.  But it isn?t written that way.  

So the key to avoid getting divorced raped (yea yea, I know....don?t get married) is to make sure your spouse makes as much money as possible during the marriage.  Do NOT let her be a stay at home mom for any significant length of time.  Do NOT let her work part time.  Make sure she?s bringing in as much as she can.

I don't have a deep divorce, cheating story like most of you guys. I don't know, I could see bullshit women spit since I know myself. I remember looking at kids at my high school, seeing how they treat meals, dates to their so called ""girlfriends"" and thinking to myself ""what a retard"". So, I've been GMOW without knowing I was GMOW.


Eventually I lost my war against social conditioning and found a girlfriend. To be honest, I was mostly curious about the sex and considering I was a 18 years old good looking guy, I think it just had to happen. We dated for 3 months, we had sex at the end of the 3rd month and I was like ""so, that's it?"". It clearly didn't worth my 3 months. That is the only experience I have with dating, sex and women in general.


Fast forward to 2 years later. I lost my grandfather. He was a very wealthy man, real estate-wise to say the least. He apparently thought it's better to leave everything to me rather than my father, who already accumulated enough wealth by himself to live of off. Since then, I have been just traveling, buying myself cool toys and pretty much enjoying my life.


My parents used to ask how is my ""private life"" going on. I usually told them that I still haven't found ""the one"". Lately, they became much more aggressive about it. Like ""You remember <insert old family friend>? He/she has a lovely daughter and we want you to meet her"" aggressive. I also avoided that until last week.


We were supposed to have a family dinner at my place. My mother apparently invited one of those women without letting me know in advance. The evening was really awkward with my mom trying to set us up. After the woman left, I couldn't take it anymore and just said everything I thought about women, dating, marriage and having children. I told them I don't need a woman in my life because I'm not really interested in with having a family and children. I can afford a cleaning lady, cook by myself or basically order. I told them, a woman at this point will be a liability to me. After hours of blaming and convincing attempts, they told me that they are ashamed of me and that they didn't raise me to be that selfish.

I get into these episodes where I just want to be comforted by a women. When I get home tired and stressed and I haven't eaten a lot and I am barely surviving I just want someone to hug me and tell me I am doing the best I can right now and that this is temporary. Unfortunately, this is unrealistic to want. Still, there's a subconscious want for it, and it aches my heart I will never know it. It's weird honestly. I want a girl to totally seduce me and make me go total simp mode but none of them seem worth really anything. I met one a few weeks ago who got me close to that but I later talked to her more and although her beauty is amazing you get used to it and she just becomes another girl. I know girls can't provide anything in my life. I struggle to think of one. They don't even provide sex since they are concious people so they can control and deny it. Unless you are in the top precent of guys, at least in my experience, she won't even attempt to care about you and will find your mental bullshit tiring, your problems annoying and pathetic, I remember my mom complaining about my dad's mental problems to me when I was younger, I heard this from my own mom, you think a young women would be any different?

I feel like my tax dollars go to things that don't benefit me and I am working to keep a society afloat that I don't want to be a part of anymore but I can't escape. There's no new lands or frontiers. I feel cornered and unable to escape any of this. My only escape would be that I can feel like I am in the top percentage of guys because the girl I hypothetically would be with cares about me. I can feel successful. But I know I'm not. I know I will have to give up so much for so little. Just like the girl I found attractive. She will seem amazing for the first couple weeks but then you get used to her and your ability to put up with her bullshit gets used up. Stress builds up. You don't want to be in this anymore.

Setting aside the fact that *of course she didn't do shit to build Amazon* and, well, the CEO doesn't ""own"" the company, that got me thinking.

MacKenzie Bezos will indeed walk away with a very substantial equity position in Amazon and no one knows how she'll vote as a shareholder. Bezos, having founded the company (and likely lost his relationship through that hard work) has been a reliable shareholder, with a specific vision. With a good part of his equity going to her, no one knows how she'll vote. Her taking a significant portion of the stock actually undermines the value of the stock itself, potentially, because she's a newbie investor with no real experience and now a huge share of control.

So really, when you think about it, any time you have a principal of a company who is married and has a significant share of stock, that's potential risk factor and not one discussed much by analysts.

So, as a preface, I have been getting used by women in plain sight for nearly all of my adolescent life and only just now realizing this. I'm a middle aged man, single/unmarried with no children, well-paying career, own a fun car and comfy house, and have been raised almost exclusively by women with very few legitimate male figures in my life. When there were any they weren't around for very long before being driven out by reasons I was too young to understand.

&#x200B;

I never thought of women as manipulative, conniving or egotistical. I had always thought they were just the most beautiful creatures and naturally gravitated toward them just like the filthy beta male I am sad to admit I was. Still, I went largely unnoticed despite being Mr Nice. But now that I am very well off financially, mentally and physically, suddenly a few of the girls from my past have somehow managed to find and contact me. Of course, being the thirsty male that I was, I was ecstatic! ...So ecstatic that I was blinded by the truth. Their true motives for contacting me never crossed my mind... And all too soon, I found myself forking out large sums of money to them both after hearing their sob story about how life is not working out for them, and how they are divorced with a child or two. Two women who do not know each other reached out to me, and I began financially and emotionally supporting them both without thinking.

I am deeply disappointed in myself. The red pill is one of the roughest pills I have ever had to swallow because the more I research the more depressing and dark it becomes. I wish I could say it's funny how when I gave women attention I was ignored and when I ignored THEM and just focused on myself, they came back. But it's NOT funny. It's not funny at all to be the punchline of a joke you never knew you were part of. I am beginning to see the big picture and its the most ugliest painting imaginable. Full of the red flags and misleading patterns that can have you staring at the picture for ages, fully immersed and captivated as it slowly steals your soul and sanity. You begin to wonder what exactly is this picture trying to hide behind all of this complexity. You try to dismantle it line by line, only to end up with a dead end and no solution. A never ending labyrinth that once reaching the exit, you are placed back to the beginning. The only way out has been there all along. You press Pause, and you leave this stupid game. We have always had that option available to us, but its not easy to see the controller in your hands when you are so focused on a problem at face-level. Because men are thinkers and problem solvers. I have been oblivious for so long. The thing that triggered this was from a youtuber, Redpill Coach, who brought up the 3 basic things women want from a man.

&#x200B;

1. Psychological security (AKA, emotional support)
2. Physical protection (AKA, physical support)
3. Providing materially (AKA, financial support)

&#x200B;

To me, these seem like reasonable and simple things to aspire for in a life-long partner. I don't see anything wrong with any of those. Except how they are acquired from men by women, in the sneakiest way possible. As I continued into MGTOW videos and content, I am beginning to see something I could never see before. If you can prove to do at least 1 out of 3 of those, SOME type of woman will cling to you, no matter what, depending on her individual level of desperation. Obviously women who are in higher demand will be able to require all 3 and get just that and nothing less.

However, a single mother nearing 30 will settle for only 1 if she needs, and a 2nd would be a huge bonus.

Unfortunate to say, I am prime example being roped into this concept. I was tying the noose to swing around my neck without me even knowing that I was. I have been providing #1 and #3 to these two women from my past who ignored me. #2 being only a plane flight away. Thankfully before that happened, one day, or rather, too many months too late, I decided to test them. I told them I was cutting my financial support to them due to some legit reason as best as I could pull off as convincing enough to them. Sure enough, they did not explode on me, but instead told me that it was ""OK"", and that ""at least I can continue to support them emotionally.""

TWO. SEPARATE WOMEN told me the EXACT same thing. This here was a HUGE eye opener for me. Because by me taking away #3, they were desperate enough to fall back on #1 just to keep me around as the bare minimum. It's not like it cost them anything to keep me around either, right? They still gained at no expense. I just proved myself right and it is the most disturbing and depressing thing I have ever experienced.

How did this happen to me? They are playing me for the fool and I am happily letting them with a smile on my face. I don't want to be a part of this system anymore. It's all a big game of deception and I am biologically programmed to fall for it because I am a predictable, simple-minded horny man with nothing to gain from courting women but everything to lose. This is like going to a casino that you KNOW is rigged to be against your favor 100% without exception, and you have been TOLD this to your face by many people, yet you still go there thinking you can somehow magically win one day.

All of that money I've donated to these struggling mothers could have easily been invested into something far more redeeming or useful, like food sent to children in Africa, or Children hospitals, or business investment, or even just paying off something in advance, or even keeping it in a savings account where it does nothing at all for any short period of time - even that would have been a better thing to do. Yet, instead I literally just assembled a mountain of cash in my backyard and set it all on fire. Where I stop providing, they will find someone who will, and not give me a second glance back, no matter how much I've helped them to this point. This has to be the very definition of being used.

After recently discovering MGTOW and the red pill, I am beginning to awaken and see the evil I never wanted to believe existed. I can't help but feel deeply disgusted with myself that I have allowed myself to be used to the most extreme form of being used; as a damn slave to people that I am socially well above. They are too clever. Or, rather, the will to survive is powerful that anything can be used as a tool, and then disposed of when done with. I'm too compassionate for my own good. It's difficult for me to say ""no"" to people who are stuck in a dire predicament but this is something I feel I am going to need to learn because I am noticing a trend that whenever I pull someone up out of a rut, I fall into one myself, and the people that I have helped are suddenly no where to be found. I need to stop forgetting that my life is about me and what I want to do with it, and things that jeopardize that basic principle should not be part of my life at all.

A super hero who receives no credit for his good deeds can easily either become a villain, or emotionally detached to the point that he will no longer bother trying to save and protect - and will let the world burn. Thus, Misogyny and MGTOW are born, respectively. Thankfully, I am not heartless enough to go the route of the former, because I believe self-reflection and self-correction is far useful to do rather than just pointing fingers at others for what they're doing. I am willing to point the finger at myself and work towards bettering myself, so I choose MGTOW and I will ever look back.

1171,"We can say a lot about the psychological and social differences between women but I think it comes down to a fear of failure in the end. It seems to be a pretty simple realization once you actually look at the way they behave instead of listening to the narrative pushed on you by society. Blindly believing the bullshit that you are told is what leads to men being so confused about what turns out to be very simple. You almost become an oracle once you accept the MGTOW/""red pill"" philosophy. You can see it on echo chambers like relationshipadvice, where time and time ago you see this story:

My girlfriend is acting more distant lately and hiding her phone. When we talk she seems disinterested and she went from texting me all the time to taking forever to respond.

Then you get the inevitable flood of comments that make logical sense, if women were men. ""Maybe she's stressed from work, have you considered talking to her?"" ""Maybe she just wants some alone time."" ""Maybe you've been coming across as needy/clingy, give her some space."" Then a week later there's an update that she's cheating. Big surprise. Or a guy is getting ghosted and goes ""I know she's been studying for midterms"" and everyone goes ""that's it, she's just busy"", as if people nowadays don't live on their phones. The idea that a person is so consumed with studying for two weeks that they don't have thirty seconds to text someone they're interested in, makes more sense to them than ""they're ghosting me.""

How does anyone actually believe any of this, honestly? I suppose it comes from an idealistic view of people, that we completely ignore what is plainly in front of us. They try to draw a tesseract as the quickest line between two points.

One of my favorite things is reading the Story Time threads on r/tinder, the same way I love cringe and outrage subreddits. The women stories are 75% them getting passively seduced by some Chad or talking about the ways the man failed to impress them; the guys talk about random ghosting and rejection with the occasional (temporary) success story. The other 25% of women stories are ""I really like this guy but I'm scared to ask him how he feels"" when it's obvious he likes her. They are just petrified by the idea of direct communication and possible rejection, even if the guy is driving three hours to see her, texts her he had a great time, kisses her at the end, buys her roses. It's absurd. Read any story told by a woman and look at how obviously their fear of failure/rejection permeates everything. They straight up say it half the time. I suppose there are also stories of women who are by any definition of the word sluts and just go around randomly sleeping with people, and chronicle it on that thread as if anyone cares they slept with multiple random guys over the weekend after five minutes of chatting. I can't shame them too much about it because I certainly enjoyed some delivery pussy but it is ridiculous. 

They go through life on training wheels even if they daydream that they're badass ninja warriors on motorcycles. Men learn failure and rejection because of things like being the ones expected to approach women. So we get laughed at, turned down, mocked, and it hurts like hell but eventually you scar over. People tell you ""keep trying, you just have to bear with it."" Eventually you toughen up, because everyone keeps telling you to do it. On the other hand, women simply don't do it, because they don't have to. The MGTOW philosophy says we don't have to either, but despite our reputation as ""incels"" most of us had to go through this blue-pilled woman-chasing process before ending up here. I certainly banged my head against the wall a few hundred times before I started to think ""was any of this really worth the sex?"" You start off wanting a relationship, end up accepting casual sex, then finally just give up.

The thing is it's not healthy at all for women. It's a large part of why they get an anxiety attack over a biology 101 exam, because they never have learned how to fail. Once you fuck up enough times you realize the consequences of anything are almost always bearable if not negligible. It's our fear of failure that fucks us up. Take pride in the fact that you have been forced to fail and suffer. There are women that I respect, often people like patients that have struggled with something like cancer and came out the other side alive. They learn to fight back.

Society shelters women so much that they never develop an immune system. Look at adversity as a vaccine. A fucking breeze can sweep a woman away, to the point they get triggered over reading fictional accounts of things. Read the story of some dude trying to lose his virginity, or a social outcast trying to interact with the outside world, and it closely mirrors the anxious language so common to women.

And that's the main difference between us, and why they have so many random little shit tests, roundabout ways of saying things, expect you to read their minds, or act passive-aggressive. It's all to deflect as much responsibility as possible from themselves, because if they aren't responsible for something then failure is something they never have to look in the eye.

1179,"Although some women are independent,  Women earn 38% of all income but spend 74% of it all.  Women are still very much dependent on men.  Men pay 70% of all taxes in USA, and 74-80% in UK, depending what study you read.  But men don't get half the tax benefits, it [goes disproportionately to women](https://www.avoiceformen.com/featured/research-finds-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/).  Women feel entitled to be financially provided for by men, (even after children are old enough to not need direct supervision).  Feminists have reinforced women's financial entitlements from men through divorce legislation.

Imagine a world where a woman was legally required to be financially responsible for herself and had no legal entitlement to force a man, married or not, to financially provide for her.  She could also not legally entitle herself to financial entitlements for herself by having children (like welfare payments).  Welfare would only be for the children if a woman had a baby.  This would force women to be responsible for themselves and would stop almost all new welfare cases in 9 months.

Even in this case, you notice that I didn't say she has to be responsible financially for the children.  I'm doing this to illustrate that even a bias against men financially could still help child poverty.  Because she has to be responsible for herself, instead of a man being forced to provide for her and children if married, he only has to provide for himself and children.

Framed another way, the money that would have been 'directed' from him to her, is instead directed to his children.  Poor men could then direct more resources to their children, and through successive generations progressively improve the lives of their children.

They cannot choose a man that they want, a man that would be good for them. They are unable to say no to scum that will destroy them further than they already are. They exhibit predictably unpredictable behavior. They cannot love anything besides themselves(I'm not sure if they actually love their kids or see them as a part of themselves) and they will never get any genuine love because of that. With feminism, women are self destructing even more. They cannot understand that, they never will, they just follow what the herd does. They will never pair bond with a man(some can only with their first but they won't stay). Our culture encourages them to self destruct even more. Women need a good man or they will go extinct. But our culture doesn't let a man keep them on a leash. When women grow old they will eventually feel the lack of love and being narcissistic they will fall into depression. They cannot realise that. No amount of rational talking with them can help. They are deeply sick and we cannot help them even if we wanted to. For me they're like robots who have gone insane. They are empty shells that absorb their current man's values only for them to change when they new branch comes in. They are nothing without a man. If you spend enough time with a woman you will realise that she is dead deep down. You can see it in their eyes, they're just empty....dead.

Our goals involve us to seek our own life style which doesn?t involve women or children.

We are fundamentally a group set to guide men into NOT falling into the traps of society. 
This current anti-male society that are brainwashing men at an exceptional rate leading to an increased rate of simps and betas (my cousin and a very close friend of mine has fallen heavily into this - one of them is self proclaimed SJW and RADICAL feminist). 

Overtime- if our voices aren?t heard and if we don?t guide our youngsters in the right path. Not only will they be chewed up and broken, but MGTOW will die down once the older generations leave us.

> I came home from work today and noticed that my spider's enclosure had been slightly moved. I thought that perhaps somebody had moved the enclosure to get a better view of my tarantula, because it wasn't uncommon for guests to do so. However, upon closer inspection of it, I found out that the lid wasn't properly sealed on. I knew immediately that something was off about this situation, because in the history of owning my tarantula, nobody had ever opened the lid of the enclosure to look at her.

> When I noticed the lid was unsealed, I took it off and searched all around the enclosure for my spider, but she was nowhere to be found. My heart sank to my stomach when I realized that she was no longer in her enclosure. I immediately ran to my girlfriend, who had been inside the apartment all day, and asked her if she had any guests over. She said no. I told her my spider was missing, and then her face went blank and she looked away from me. My heart sank, because I knew something happened.

> I asked her repeatedly where my spider went, and she kept saying she didn't know, but eventually she told me the truth, she told me she killed my spider. I started crying, because I loved that spider. I know spiders are unconventional pets, but I had her for 10 years and went through a lot of tough times with her. I asked her why she did it, why she hurt me and my spider which I was so fond of, and she told me ""I couldn't stand having it inside because it creeped me out so much."" I asked her what she did to her, and she told me she scooped her out of her enclosure with a cup, put her on the ground, and then stepped on her and put her body in the trash. I told her not to talk to me and left to go to my parents house, where I'm currently staying for an unknown amount of time.

> I knew that my tarantula creeped her out, but she's known about her since before we started dating. I told her if it was a problem, then let me know, but she didn't say much after I assured her that I'm extremely cautious and protective of the spider. She knew that in all of the time I owned the spider, it had never gotten out on accident. She's lived with the spider for roughly a year now, and despite the occasional ""eww it's so creepy"" comment, she never seemed bothered by it.

1227,"We all have an evil woman that turned us to MGTOW so I figured I would go ahead and share my story, give you guys something to read while you're bored at work.

In college, met a girl, she had actually started seeing one of my good friends at the time but he was being an asshole towards her so she kinda drifted to me (I was a nice guy, raised in the south, grew up blue pilled, treat women like queens, etc.) and we really hit it off. Eventually ended up living together (I know, but it was actually a much cheaper alternative than my other options, plus I was young and stupid so). Made a great couple, active sex life, had fun doing just about anything together, etc. We graduated and I got a job back in her home town coincidentally, so that's where I was headed and she decided to come with me.

Things started to slowly decline. She blamed it on all the negativity in her hometown (her parents weren't very good and apparently she had a bad past) but I figured it was nothing, I could help her through it. Love conquers all right? (HAHAHAHAHA, no).

After six months or so of us both having jobs, I proposed to her and we got married (diamond rings all that shit), I'll spare you the details. Well guess who didn't get laid on his wedding night? Yep. This guy. Or hardly at all on the honeymoon. Whatever, I wrote it off as stress from the wedding so I assumed it would pass.

Fast forward, bought a house, had it for about 3 years. During this time we have struggled even more to have sex and she always had an excuse. ""I just have too much on my mind"" ""I just can't relax"" etc etc the list goes on. Every now and then we'd have it when she was magically in the mood. During this time I wanted her to talk to a doctor or seek a professional about it because it was driving a wedge between us. She never did.

December 2018, another breakdown, another argument about how bad our marriage was. Told her we either go to counseling or I can't do it anymore, so we go.

Go to counseling for \~4 appointments. Wife doesn't really do the homework we were assigned. During one of the appointments she says ""I just really need my space"". Well hmm this got me thinking. This is something she has NEVER said like EVER. She always wanted to be around me and doing things with me all the time if at all possible. The concept of her needing space away from me all of a sudden just didn't add up.

Well she starts isolating herself to our guest room every night stating she was just decompressing or whatever. I'm like okay I'll play video games or something. (Which I rarely got to do since she was so controlling with my time, so I was sorta happy about it.)

Well after about 4 counseling appointments she comes to me and says she wants to leave, that she doesn't think it's helping. She said anything from ""I'm just bored"" to  ""you don't support me and my career"" (which I have no idea where that came from since I always supported her moving up at work and was proud of her for her accomplishments). These were obviously bullshit reasons. I was so hurt, bawling, crying. I made a commitment and I wanted to stick to it and make it work, truly for better or worse but she didn't care anymore. I honestly don't think me being so upset phased her at all, just so cold and cruel.

Well she gets a lawyer, moves out, has to move in with her parents because she doesn't make enough to live on her own. Later on we talk about starting over and trying again to fix things. She states that she realizes now what she had and wishes she had just appreciated it more and put more effort into it. Being the analytical person that I am, I didn't take this at face value so I drilled into her with ""Why's"" until I got the truth.

Well guess what gentlemen, she had done gone and fucked someone else. Which, I normally wouldn't care because whatever you're gone now, do as you please, except she did this BEFORE coming to me saying she screwed up, not to mention all the sexual rejection she gave me as her husband, her provider, the person who cared about her the most and treated her like a queen. So yeah it really is that quick and easy for them. They can be on a different cock as soon as they leave you, if not before they leave.

Found out from a mutual friend that she had been talking to this guy pretty much all along since things started to unravel. I don't know where he came from or who he is but my hunch is that the ""space"" she needed was just her talking to this guy about our marriage and I've no doubt he was agreeing with her and going along with it just to get her into bed. So between stupid emotional wife and this asshole of a Chad, she got her mind made up that she just wanted a divorce and nothing I could have said or done would have mattered.

Now she is regretting her decision big time and feels like a fucking idiot but there's no way I could go back now, I'd be disrespecting myself. Besides, I'm happy and healthier now, and she's more unhappy than she was when we were married (guess that really says it all). 

Anyway guys, AWALT and don't ever forget it. Don't ever think you found a unicorn because you probably didn't. Don't ever get married as there's no benefit. I was actually fortunate in my case, didn't lose much (kept my house and my cat) and no kids. Ironically it all started with me white knighting and saving her from some asshole and ended with her leaving me for some asshole (that I'm pretty certain just pumped and dumped her, and BTW he ought to be beaten for being a homewrecker, that's not how you treat a fellow man).

1257,"Although some women are independent,  Women earn 38% of all income but spend 74% of it all.  Women are still very much dependent on men.  Men pay 70% of all taxes in USA, and 74-80% in UK, depending what study you read.  But men don't get half the tax benefits, it [goes disproportionately to women](https://www.avoiceformen.com/featured/research-finds-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/).  Women feel entitled to be financially provided for by men, (even after children are old enough to not need direct supervision).  Feminists have reinforced women's financial entitlements from men through divorce legislation.

Imagine a world where a woman was legally required to be financially responsible for herself and had no legal entitlement to force a man, married or no, to financially provide for her.  She could also not legally entitle herself to financial entitlements for herself by having children (like welfare payments).  Welfare would only be for the children if a woman had a baby.  This would force women to be responsible for themselves and would stop almost all new welfare cases in 9 months.

Even in this case, you notice that I didn't say she has to be responsible financially for the children.  I'm doing this to illustrate that even a bias against men financially could still help child poverty.  Because she has to be responsible for herself, instead of a man being forced to provide for her and children if married, he only has to provide for himself and children.

Framed another way, the money that would have been 'directed' from him to her, is instead directed to his children.  Poor men could then direct more resources to their children, and through successive generations progressively improve the lives of their children.

Even in this hypothetical situation, men would still be carrying a disproportionate load.  My point is that prioritizing women's financial entitlements from men hurts his children.",0,1556299677.0,bhozzl,2,MGTOW

I was on a stag at the weekend and the idea of society favouring men came up in conversation naturally with another bloke.  I asked him multiple times for examples on how society favoured men and the the only one he offered (several times) was that the majority of the FTSE 100 list was taken up by men. SImply not relevant imo - you may as well say because theyre mostly 45+ that society favours the old. Despite the many, many examples I gave of the opposite he just stubbornly would not accept it and later (albeit it jokingly) said to my mate 'didn't realise x (me) was a  misogynist , which Im not.'

1295,"Hi guys I am new to MGTOW, I don't know if this is the right place to ask but I don't know WTF is wrong with women? Is it just modern society or women have always been like this?


I have been rethinking my life lately, in the past 8 months perhaps, I was a stupid leftist got sucked into the feminist cult, and all the garbage that they promoted and the groupthink, it was basically the breaking point why I left that crap. In fact to be honest I never even really believed in the feminist crap I just went along with it mostly, although I wanted just equality, simple respectable equality between men and women, I realized how agressively they pushed the feminist narrative and censored me whenever I pointed out how men are opressed in modern society and how easy women have it with all the technological, legal and economic privileges that they got, not to mention the eternal power of the vagina. I start to realize that this itself is still weak, so I have been reading up on MGTOW the past 2 weeks and I already knew about it in the past, though I used to dismiss it, but now I am getting blackpilled or how do you say it, I am really starting to figure out just how problematic women are. I have been doing a lot of introspection, rethinking my whole life, and the women that I met in my life and I start to think that it's disastruous.

My last GF broke up with me in the middle of being in a low point. I was depressed the past few years and had some personal problems, I met this girl before that and we were together about 3 years. Initially she supported me and cared for me, but then she slowly faded away, the relationship went cold and she became disinterested. She couldn't or wouldn't want to bear my burden, and then 1 day she just broke up with me and left without a say. Then later she apologized and wanted us to remain friends, which I agreed to. To my knowledge she didn't had other guys she was kind of lonely too, but
just the mere fact that she would have to stick around and support me emotionally was too much for her and she couldn't take it. Fucking spoiled cunt. She hit me when I was on the ground, it felt very bad, I was even more depressed after that, but now I am recovering and have mostly recovered. I have rethinked my ideology and my entire life meaning and I have came to the conclusion that being individualist is the best way to live your life, because it gives you all the freedom to enjoy the pleasures that you have without any of the burdens that come with it. So naturally MGTOW is the next step I believe.

Women are just so different, I don't know WTF is this. I realized that I don't even enjoy their presence anymore, and have already started adopting some isolationist tactics that I read, I keep contact and chit-chat to a bare minimum now. You can't even talk to them, it's like they are a different species.

Like this modern SJW liberal culture is as bad as it gets so you can't have meaningful conversations anymore with people. With males it's like about 40-50% of them are low tier sheeps, with whom you can only talk basic stuff like your personal life, ironically women issues, sports, the weather, and basic stuff like this. About 30% of them are above average with whom you can have a normal male-to-male conversation about higher topics like politics, ethics, ideology, culture, science. And about 20% of them are geniuses with whom you can have a very high level conversation about high philosophy and expert topics in whatever field you are interested.

With women it's like you are talking to a sack of rocks. About 95% of women, and I am not exagerating, are as dumb as a sack of rocks. You can never really go beyond talking about trivial stuff: relationship issues, family, sex, work, and basic hobby, and perhaps politics (but only surface level namecalling, but not deep theory, ever). Even if you try to bring up more complex issues, they become instantly turned off, and start doing something else, play with their phones, or just do do something else. You can never, ever ever have a meaningful conversation with 95% of women, they are as dumb and indifferent as a sack of rocks. Then about 4.99% of women are above average with whom you can go to talk about beyond surface trivia but even here you have to be careful to avoid **keywords** that might trigger her pre-programmed feminist ideology, and become hysterical and defensive, spoiling the chances of having a calm rational debate and end up screaming and insulting eachother in the end. And only about 0.01% of women are respectable, whom I can admire, who actually have done something with their lives and can behave rationally. Ironically these women eventually inhibit male traits. Like my doctor is a woman, and I respect her, she is very professional and talented, but she has short hair, deep male voice, and has military style discipline which makes her more manly than womanly. Rest assured the women in the top 0.01% are not the dumb blonde bimbos you meet at the mall.

So overall just being a woman is very weird and problematic. Like how the fuck is this even possible? Is the pussy power so strong that males have been manipulated by women for centuries to sustain them, whereas they themselves are essentially useless otherwise. Like I really start to think that the only thing good about a woman is her pussy and her tits, and they are just masturbatory toys for men to have pleasure and make babies. Everything else about them is worthless. There is nothing that they can do, and feminists are trying real hard to hide this fact. How are even women able to survive without men looking out for them, or the govt giving them welfare? They are so stupid and irrational that just by natural chances they would naturally go away, if they would not be necessary to make babies.

And I am really tired of engaging women, it's just so predictable what will happen, it's almost cringy. Whenever I go to a date, it's like it either ends up in the bedroom or with some lousy excuse that she is ""not ready yet"" or whatever. It's soooo predictable every single time, like what is the point of dates even, why not just flip a fucking coin, and if it lands on the head, we fuck and if on tails then we part our ways. What is the need fo this dumb ritual of asking girls out, spending a lot of money on them just to get access to her meat purse. It's very dumb if you think about it. It's just paying for her comfort. And the talk that she gives on dates is just so boring, like I should just leave and let her talk to herself because I don't care about her little brother painting the fridge accidentally or her little cousin being too goofy at his birthday. Why do I even have to listen to this crap just to have access to her pussy? I am interested in tech, I work in IT, I want to talk about the internet and coding, but then I would come out as a lousy nerd. Like how cringy it would be if I would start talking about Javascript bugs and PHP tricks at a date instead of her dumb cousin, she would get embarassed and would leave, because she is too dumb and too comfortable to even have to use her brains to make money by this. All my female colleagues are essentially just props, they only do basic shit, and a white knight colleague always helps them make up for their deficiency. Women are really useless in every field which requires an IQ above 90. I repeat there are no women in IT because they are dumb, and the women that somehow do get there can only do basic shit (that I used to do when I was 11 years old) and a white kinght will always cover for them, they don't deserve their paycheck. 

I have never met a single intelligent woman in my entire personal life (except in professional relations). Not a single girlfriend, not a single friend that I hanged out with, not a single neighbors or work colleague, not a single schoolmate, not even my own mother.

Even my own mother, who I love and care for her, but even she is very irrational and hysterical, and I can't talk with her about complex things. I have never had a single deep conversation in my entire life with her, it was always a shallow superficial conversation. I don't know about you guys, or I don't know what a normal family would look like, but from seeing it in movies (which should not be regarded as a standard), I thought that mothers always sit down with their kids and have a deep talk with them about their future, or ethics and morality. I haver had that with my mom. We are talking, and it's not that she is abusive or anything, we have a normal relationship, we are not angry at eachother or anything, but it's just that our relationship is very shallow. I have never been able to have a deep conversation with her about anything. Even when I asked her about dating advice, and told her the problems I had with girlfriends, she just shrugged it off and said ""well girls are like that just get used to it"" or ""this girl is bad but you will find a better one"". 

No I didn't, every single girl that I dated was a dumb shallow cunt, and I didn't even go after the hoe sluts, I instinctually knew to stay far from them, my type is the ""little cute princess type with a nice ass"", so I mostly dated girls with 1-2 partners and even virgins when I was young (though I didn't take their virginity, they stabbed me in the back just before we were about to fuck). I was a good gentleman, always bought flowers, was a nice guy, but they mostly treated my like trash and always expected things from me. They never really surprized me with anything or never initiated anything. Like even sex was like a begging, I had to beg them to have sex, and they were like ""oh reall you want to fuck again, not now sweetie I am tired maybe tomorrow"". I was like a child that needs to beg them to do something because they would have never initiated anything. Like the money and time I wasted on these cunts, I would have expected at least 1 of them to say ""hey baby do you want us to go upstairs and have some fun"", it never happened, I always had to beg them to get anything. You know not ""beg"" like to humiliate myself, but ""beg"" in the sense that I had to be the initiator always and I had to push them going out of my way to even have access to their cunts. It felt so unnatural, I always thought (from stupid movies of course) that women are really loving and caring and playful, but every single dumb cunt I have been with was a passive shallow soulless prop that wouldn't even have moved her fingers if I wouldn't have said something. Maybe I was just extremely unlucky in my dating life but I think he evidence is clear that it isn't just me.

Now every time I go out somewhere and some fat hoe starts looking at me, and tries to flirt, it's just so irritating. Like these are the only women that would have initiate something but I am not into fat women. But the women that I like, are always passive. I mean God is it really too much to ask for to just take the initiative, why do they behave like all they have between their 2 ears is mush. These dumb cunts who sit on FB all day and text eachother with their phones, and really have no life essence in them just to ""feel good"" date as many guys as possible and make sure their comfort and income is sustained by some loser white knights.

I am really getting tired of women and it gets harder and harder to even want to enter into a relationship with anyone. Like since I am free, I just feel so good and so liberated. I can sleep better, I can do my hobbies, and can organize my time schedule the way I want (since my work schedule is flexible). I can shave myself the way I want. I can wear the clothes I want and just spend time reading more and learning.

When I was in a relationship, yes it partially felt good for the emotional attachment, and the pussy was good, better than my left hand and a blanket. But everything else was bad. I constantly felt under stress ""what if I said something that hurt her"" , ""what if she wants to break up"" , ""how to get her to do this and that"". It was such an extra burden that I don't need anymore. The breaking up is hard because of the emotions, but everything that comes after is much more liberating and lively. Like always having to go to those boring dates when she talks about dumb cousings and trivial crap like that, it feels like a stupid ritual just to get the pussy, and I really hate repetitive things. Like you have to do X, Y and Z which you hate, but you do it for the pussy no? Fuck that, I'd rather get some prostitutes or whatever, it's not worth being in relationship at all. She doesn't care about you, she never pays attention to you, and she will drop you anyway after she finds a chad, why should you do it? And why risk it, since we all know about this crap with rape accusations and alimony payments for long term relationships. It feels like the pussy is just a curse for males.

Search for antonyms of any masculine trait to discover the equivalent feminine trait.   

The MGTOW movement is a natural response to the current imbalance between the two poles of masculine and feminine.   Men are walking away in droves because feminism removed the societal constraints that kept female nature in-check.  

Those constraints were put in place by men who rebuilt previous societies that females destroyed.  These constraints were never about ""oppression"", they were about protection.

JD Unwin's book [Sex and Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_Culture) documents the rise and fall of every great civilization over the past 5,000 years.  What he discovered is astounding, every single one of them followed the same pattern that we are experiencing today. 

> These societies lived in different geographical environments; they belonged to different racial stocks; but the history of their marriage customs is the same. In the beginning each society had the same ideas in regard to sexual regulations. Then the same struggles took place; the same sentiments were expressed; the same changes were made; the same results ensued. Each society reduced its sexual opportunity to a minimum and displaying great social energy, flourished greatly. Then it extended its sexual opportunity; its energy decreased, and faded away. The one outstanding feature of the whole story is its unrelieved monotony.

[This blog post](https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/30/jd-unwin-detailed-how-feminism-would-destroy-culture-30-years-before-womens-lib/) summarizes the Sex and Culture book.  Definitely worth reading.

In all of these societies, the loosening of restrictions of females lead to feminism which lead to the decline and collapse of the society.  Unwin also stated that you can never undo it, once the genie is out of the bottle it can never be put back.

Here's [another article](http://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-problem-with-feminism-why.html) that references Unwin's work when discussing the role of feminism and the collapse of the west.   

JD Unwin discovered that these societies collapsed within 10 generations, or about 250 years.  The United States was founded in 1776, but the Boston Tea Party happened in 1773 and this was arguably the spark that gave birth to our nation.

The 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party will occur in the year 2023. This is eerily close to both the end of Trump's first term, as well as his second term if he gets reelected.

Girls back then just seamed like a huge money sink and something that would just hold me back from reaching my dreams. 

I have also been and I still am a very active amateur boxer (I do about 10 hours of boxing per week) and a very regular gym goer.

And so far it worked great! Im generally incredibly fit and my business has really started to pick up some steam but after two years the whole ?no girls? thing is starting to wear on me.

It?s especially bad since girls started to give me more and more attention everywhere I go ( not to brag but im a pretty good looking guy). It?s getting even worse now in the spring since there are hot girls literally EVERYWHERE! 

I also don?t hang out with friends that often anymore since im so super busy but when I do all they talk about is girls and most of them have girlfriends. 

Now I know girls are a bad idea in general but in my situation they would be really bad since I barely have any free time as it is. All I do is work, go to the gym and box and I do it 6-7 days a week. I would literally have no time for a girlfriend even if I wanted to.

I also couldn?t ?smash and dash? easily since I have put all my saving into starting my business and am therefore still living with my parents which kinda makes sense since I only come home to sleep.

It is an absolute minefield and you risk having you life completely destroyed in a blink of an eye.

Today I have been thinking about a different breed of women, ESCORTS. And I came to some very interesting conclusions.

&#x200B;

For those who still like sex, ESCORTS mean:

&#x200B;

FREEDOM - you are able to enjoy pleasure without giving up control of your life.

HAPPINESS - going full monk mode takes a dent in your spirit. Strong men carry on but there are other ways.

PEACE OF MIND - you no longer have to worry about pleasing women to get them to cooperate with you.

FUN - I mean, how much fun can be a regular dose of good sex.

NOVELTY - a different woman everytime is as good as it gets.

SAFE - most of these women practice safer sex than the ones you meet online. Plus, no pregnancies, no lawsuits, no clinging, no daddy issues, no nothing.

TRUE - these women are true in their intentions, they take your money and have sex with you. Everybody is happy.

MEMORIES - later on you will always have good memories of these encounters, that will put a smile in your face everytime.

FREE TIME - you get to have sex AND get to keep your free time for yourself, unlike in a relationship.

DEPENDABLE - you can always have sex with them whenever YOU feel like. No headaches and other bullshit.

COST EFFECTIVE - seriously, just pop up a spreadsheet and check out how much your previous relationships have costed.

NO CONTRACT - whenever you feel like taking a break and save some money, no one will come after you.

&#x200B;

and...

&#x200B;

OUTCASTS - most men are outcasts in modern society, women treat us like shit. They control the sex supply and use it to keep men on a leash. Well, escorts are breaching this barricade and coming through to our side. Like us, they are hated by most women. We should welcome them and treat them well because they are here to help us. They simply get paid for their time, like most of us in our jobs, no big deal about that. Escorts take power away from feminists and give it to men.

Like I said, random thoughts...

Really very much leaning towards mgtow after a 17 year relationship with my ex-wife. The last straw was her cheating on me FYI. 

Really really wondering if a decent human being who happens to be male can find an equal. A partner in life of the opposite sex. 

Or is there no hope for real happiness with a woman? I want to find happiness and a companion but I?m not sure it?s worth it anymore. 

I?ve dated and every single relationship has ended because I wasn?t feeling something for her and decided it was best for both of us in each instance. Not every single time but most, they developed feelings for me but for whatever reason I did not. 

Perhaps I?m just going through a phase? I do not know. The female body, to me, is the epitome of art and attractiveness so I know I?m not bi or gay but I?m just fed up with all of the Instagram women and all of the women I?ve been dating. 

Another thought, why don?t women understand that real men have feelings? Women always talk about wanting to feel wanted. Do they believe men don?t also crave this? I think my ex initiated sex less than 6 times over the course of 17 years.

&#x200B;

I have a problem, a simple one, but i need some advice, or any tought about it so i can add to my own thinking.

Sorry if its long, but need to get out of my mind. I had a shitty day today.

Thank for you help.

&#x200B;

**STORY :**

&#x200B;

I work in a shitty job (cant give more info about my job).

4 years i do it after 1.5 years of unemployment because of feminist/leftist have me been fired.

Part time job with irregular hours, but it paid somewhat well, 21/h and i dont do much, nothing physical and not much customers.

Its a no stress job, but its not a job made to live, nor something i can be proud of. It paid the bills and i can put in the side but it all.

&#x200B;

I'm likely to have a mental breakdown because i dont have anything to do in my work, and even bringing stuff to do (books, games or even IT projects or whatever i totally dont have the right to bring) wont prevent me of being bored.

I'm bored to death in this job. To be honest, that been 2 years i play games or do my own business, and nobody ever talked about it to my boss... (because i do my work first i suppose).

I just put my ass and wait.

That not really true because i do the job my coworker dont do. But even with that, i'm bored to death.

&#x200B;

I have one chief on site half the week, and another who is in charge of all other places.

Say one is my supervisor and the other is the manager, and also a tyrannic boss who yell nearly everytime unless its a ""good day"". Its also a family member of my supervisor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Year ago i looked up to evolve from where i'm in my professionnal life, because it has been some time, the ride was fun, but i need to go one day or another.

Have worked on construction from 17y old, as well as desk jobs.

I'm an hard worker and thought of taking adventage of my part time work to study and find a new job at the end, leaving this shithole of a job.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So i thought about studing to become an IT worker (because i always were happy with computers and have some experience in it and always tought that i couldnt work in that field and that i maybe should launch myself in this field for good).

I found a 2 years study, mainly in infrastructure field, with a certificate made for work (so in the end a business is likely to take me).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, i planned to ask my big boss (the big manager) to have the 2-3 days evenings per week free to go to class (before signing contract with the school).

Plain and simple, just asking i dont work 2-3 days evenings per week because of class, and could work any other day like normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before sending to the big boss, i asked before to my supervisor, the guy who hired me, to see if he would give me a helping hand (after all i've done for him and for the work) so the letter get like a cutter in butter.

So the thing i wanted is to add to the letter is a sentence like ""Mr. X the supervisor has nothing against the fact i have a planing agreement"". Stating he support my choice and support me in the end.

In my mind, it was so the big boss say ""Hell, if he dosent mind, go for it, i dont care.""

Because my supervisor make the planning and send it to the manager who approve (everytime) it.

So in the end the only one who have shit to do about it is my supervisor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Four years that i serve at my best, 1-2 times came to work late or miss opening hour in four years... done everything, came in my free time out of emergency, done every crap things in there, train every new guys, well, they can count on me for everything. Never asked anything and even took 2x less holidays than any others coworkers.

And you know what ? MY supervisor say to me this afternoon after reading my email : ""well, you know how he will mostly take this. And there is also the other coworker who already have an agreement. Oh you know he will see you as a guy studying during work and leaving after... so good luck."" (In short).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So in his mind, i'm a guy who come to work to get his check, dont do shit, and should get a white hand from him because i'm like any other coworker who mostly work here 1 year and get out after his study is done.

You know i give this guy christmas and birthday gift because i though i oww him having this job and somwhat ""appreciate"" him ?...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was i though will happen, sadly. But that drove me mad in a way. 

&#x200B;

I do shit everyday for 4 years, and they always complain ""we dont do shit"" while in the same time they remove us tools and work to do...

My new coworker have an agreemnt from day one for study, and the guy who hire me and know me cant support my demand after four years of loyal services.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So finally, going to the core of the problem :

&#x200B;

I have sended the letter whitout the specified phrase to the manager.

Simply stating i want to attend study, class happen 2-3 time per week and would like to be free to get to class. 

That i worked for 4 years and will stay and work any other time needed for work, just that i need those days free and i be grateful he accept this.

&#x200B;

Monday the letter should get into my big yelling boss, so i wait until he give me an answer until deciding of next move.

&#x200B;

But, my problem is simple :

&#x200B;

If i recieve a ""Ok"" i have no problem at all, as you would have understand, my goal is to continue working, studying and change job in 2 years (300% profit, 100 profit working, 100% profit studying, 100% profit putting money on the side) so there will be no problem at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

BUT, if i recieve a ""no"" wich is a 50/50 chance, i can :

&#x200B;

\- Either stay, and get more money and wait it close (because i will within 2 years nearly sure because of lack of customers and district transformation), and start class when i'm 32y, stacking money in between.

&#x200B;

\- Either i put a resign, 2 month before class start, fight with employment welfare because i resign myself and they will punish me and find ways to sort things wich will be difficult.

&#x200B;

\- Either i make everything possible to get fired (with the help of my boss (good) or truly making it impossible for them to not fire me (bad) so i can get employment welfare and start class with some piece of mind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dont take me wrong, i dont want to get on welfare. I hate this, truly. Have got 1.5 years on welfare, i cant stand social worker, nor welfare.

I prefer this job than being unemployed as it was really a chance for me after a year of unemployment to have this job... But....

But in the same time, its like a golden jail -> Leave, you lose everything. Stay, you're dying in little fire.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**So, the big question : what would you do in this kind of situation ?**

&#x200B;

Would you rather resign and deal with all the crap of welfare saying you shouldnt had made this ? Loosing all 10k emergency money in the process ?

Or stay, even dying inside with a crappy job that will inevitably close and will fire/wathever you because it cant coninue like this for 10 years ?

&#x200B;

My MGTOW mindset tell me to take my balls, resign 2 month before class start, use my emergency money to pay class and find whatever job, but in the same time, its that golden jail dilemma : staying, no stress, take money, and stop caring.

&#x200B;

So, thank for your help...

I haven't been on this sub for a while but I do Understand and like the message that MGTOW tells guys. Do what you need to do, don't let women be in control of your life, etc. I do have a few Questions. I Just turned 26 not too long ago. The job I have has me moving around a lot and doesn't really give me time to have a traditional dating in my life. What I mean by that is I have to use online dating as much as I don't like it. I feel like online dating is a joke. For one we have a lot of ""I will do anything for Pussy boys"" Out there so a lot of the women think they are too good. Two most of the time the women that you do get matched with are bots, fat chicks, or are real but just want you to pay for a meal. I even had one girl try to tell me it's normal for men to buy her things and she does nothing in return but let them be in the same space as her. So just to make this short I'll ask my question. I'm trying to get to the end game which is for me having a family with kids. Really want a son and 2 daughters  (I want the son first for the reason anyone could understand). My question is how does one get to that point. When dating now is trash. if you look at a woman the wrong way its rape. I'm just trying to understand. I love the message that MGTOW puts out but I need an end game. I don't want to be old in a big house by myself for no one to pass my hard work down to. So What do you think would be the best move.

1434,"So here's my story...

I was with a girl for a couple of years, travelled with her, thought she was a ""queen"", bought her nice things...I hadn't found MGTOW or RedPill or anything like that yet.  I come from a family where I had an extremely strong father, and mother and I figured I would be able to be the ""provider"" that I had been told I was to be.  

I started dating her, things were great but there were so many red flags that I decided to push to the side (big mistake) she had major daddy issues, still lived at home (in her late 20's) didn't really have many career aspirations aside from moving to a different country....without a plan as what to do once she got there.

I have a pretty successful career, and I was able to purchase properties where I made the mistake of moving her into my place without really having a discussion.  This was about 18 months into the relationship.  Once she moved in, her work went to shit, and the sex completely stopped.  She wouldn't chip in with anything requiring spending any money, and this is totally my fault for not nipping it in the bud right away.   

Fast forward about 6 months, I was engaged like an idiot.  It was from thinking that it was the right thing to do, and I truly believed it.  Little did I know that it was going to turn to hell.

I had a friend that she never was jealous about, until one day, she lost her goddamn mind on me for having this friend.  I was to cut this person out of my life, or else.  

Well, I wouldn't do that, because it was the one thing that I still had.  She had told her friends about this friend and they convinced her that because I wouldn't do this, that I didn't love her and that she should move out.  

One day, I came home from work to find her packing up all her shit in suitcases and saying that she was done.  

Me, being the simp I was at the time, was basically on my knees begging for her not to leave.

She moved out, my world was shattered, and I totally spiralled out of control.  Thank heavens I have great friends and family that were able to help me out. 

I had to go to therapy to get over it, and I wasn't able to get over her for over a year.

The only thing that helped, was that I had a redpilled as hell therapist that specialized in men's issues, and he was the first person that really told me to cut her out of my life completely.  

I didn't listen for about a year, but once I did, I realized how stupid I was that I ever committed to a woman like that.  

I'm 33 years old, and I'm completely free from women.  I want nothing to do with them.  Not friendship, I've spun plates, but that got really boring really quickly.

Don't get into long term relationships folks.  It's really not worth it.  They always come with ultimatums and they're never going to go your way.  Continue on growing as men, and don't hate women for what they are.  Just avoid them when possible.

Check my post history if you want more of the gritty details. 


I hired a lawyer for the lawsuit and represented myself for the restraining order hearing. I was able to show she was making false allegations during the RO hearing and the judge ruled in my favor. The RO was terminated and my rights have been fully restored. 

As for the lawsuit, I settled for a small penitence which didn't even cover her legal fees. I could have fought her for more but after almost a year, I'm willing to let go of a little cash in order to move on with my life. 

As for where I'm at today, you wouldn't recognize the man I've become after rebuilding from this experience. I've focused on my family, my friends, and most importantly myself. I've learned to never place my power in the hands of woman ever again. I will never remarry, I will never cohabitat, and I will never commingle finances with a woman ever again. I've played the field for years, I've had my fair share of women, and it's time I go my own way. Women may come and go in my life, but they will never again hold sway over me.

So, cheers and hearty thank you to the men here who helped me overcome this nightmare. As the saying goes, ""just as iron sharpens iron, men sharpen men.""

But like I said, I'm now a stronger, better man thanks to her and the men here who continue to help build other men.

The platoon was from the 101st Airborne,  which is the same one from the book / TV series ""Band of Brothers"", which hopefully most of you have seen.  Watching the movie and thinking on the differences between the two; main character in Overlord was a black guy with a good heart and conscience, naturally there was a pretty, waif-like girl who also kicked arse and took names, the Nazis were movie stereotype Nazis (cruel, mad, psychotic, etc) and the rest of the guys in the platoon were pretty one-dimensional stereotypes (""tough guy"", ""wise-cracking cynic"", etc).

Compared this to Band of Brothers (2001) which had no kick-arse femme fatales, I'm not even sure I can recall a single black or Asian guy in it and most of the Germans were portrayed as normal soldiers as well.  It was a TV series focused on being faithful to Stephen E Ambrose's book and historically accurate / realistic with no other agendas at play.  A series completely focused on making a quality production and nothing else.  It struck me that if that series was (re)made now, how badly would today's demand for equal representation, inclusion and shoe-horning social narratives into big budget productions fuck it up?  Would Easy Company suddenly have POCs and tiny girls beating up men twice their size to show women's strongkth?

It comes down to control. A woman will despise you if they can control you. The bad boy controls the relationship and the girls hate this. This is why they keep hanging on to the bad boy. Because they want to break him down. That's why women absolutely hate rejection, because the man controlled the narrative and told them to get lost. So the bad boy represents a challenge for them, it keeps their interest levels high thinking about how they are going to take control. Because most of the men are the nice guys and the girls have control and don't have to plot and scheme and hence, their interest levels don't get exercised.

And it's interesting with the real bad guys, the guys that really treat the girls like shit. The girls desire for control is so powerful that they hate themselves for continuing on with this guy but they can't help it. They want to break the guy down even if it means continuing the relationship with a piece of shit. In a way, it's pathetic.

We began talking pretty quickly and became close. About 3 weeks in she told me she had broken up with her boyfriend because of me (Red flag 1). We knew we had liked each other and she wanted to take it slow which I respected but I didn't understand. She strangely asked me not tell anybody of how we felt, though I would tell my friend would backstab me and tell her. She wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks (Red Flag 2). I remember that day that I was so frustrated with myself and that I cried in the shower for a bit though it would only be that day. I relationship would again stabilize and after a few weeks my cousin had convinced me to ask her out again. This would be about half way through my year and I wanted to enjoy it as much as possible so I did again. Even though we clearly had feelings she didn't want to and by this point she knew I was moving (Red Flag 3). I remember being disappointed but not crushed. We would still be close talking almost everyday and all day. On my last 2 days there she asked me to go to her church with her (For people not in christian dating this is like first base where you meet her friends and she chooses based on their opinions of you, stupid I know). I enjoyed it a lot and spending time with her. We acted like a couple basically the entire time. If you asked me who was the one back then, I would've confidently said her. Though it came much to late.

After I moved she wanted to go further. She asked me if we could be unofficially official (Red flag 4). We still kept talking pretty consistently for awhile though it wouldn't last long. About 2 months into long distance she broke it off claiming that every time she felt sad it traced back to her having a boyfriend. I remember just screaming WHAT a million times and to this day still have no idea what it meant. Most of freshmen year I blocked out the pain and focused on playing video games competitively (specifically team fortress 2 if you're interested). Though it slowly creeped in and took over by sophomore year and I was crushed to my very core. I had convinced myself that it was my fault and I didn't fight hard enough for her. I thought about her like a past time and constantly reminded myself of her. About every 1 or 2 months I would have to pour myself out to her to not completely collapse on myself. Most of the time I would have no response and if I did it was a short dialogue about how she did care. Though looking back on it she never cared and if she did she never showed it to me. Things I was confident in my whole life like video games, politics and choir became extremely hard and I could not confidently enjoy them. I was sent to a dark place of self-hatred for myself and I had to rebuild myself in a prison of shame and failure. I eventually blocked out my feelings towards her and began to respect and trust myself again. Late last year we began talking a little again and I let myself feel what I felt when I was 13. I knew it was dangerous for me though she accepted all the compliments that were obviously very obvious even though she had a boyfriend (Red Flag 5). I just recently about 2 months ago finally blocked her out of my life on everything, couldn't see her on social media, blocked and unfriended on all forms of communication so she couldn't talk to me. A good group of gentlemen have fully ushered me out of that era of my life and I am greatly in debt to them.

This is where a lot of people gather on someones porch to shell peas, pass a bottle of Wild Turkey and, most importantly, gossip about everyone not there. The men generally do the heavy lifting of moving the bushels of peas, and the women sit and pop the shells off. Sitting in on one of these will red pill you in a hurry.

One story that stuck out was about one woman's granddaughter, though. She had been dating a local Chad. Her parents were against it. Of course Chad's been to jail a few times on drug and burglary charges. Given that this is Florida we're talking about, this is practically like getting your drivers license in other parts of the country. Still the guy straight up told her he wasn't going to marry her.

For her part, she did well in high school, and got a softball scholarship to go to school. Now her grandma is co-owner of a bank so she has some cash, and had put back some money to help the girl through school. Her grandparents had also bought her a car to go back and forth as long as she stayed in school. Naturally she didn't stay in school. 

She proposed to Chad. He shot her down, but kept banging her. So if she gets pregnant Chad has to marry her, right? So she got knocked up and dropped out of school. She led Grandma and Grandpa along a little bit about still being in school, and they wrote a few checks 'for tuition.' Once they worked it out, though, they cut her off and had the car towed. Grandpa bought himself a new truck with the money that was left. It's a pretty nice truck, too.

For his part, Chad still wouldn't marry her. He was still hanging around banging her, though. He also wasn't supporting her, so she had to get a job at a local fast food joint. The baby came and everything stayed status quo for about a year until the hurricane struck and wiped almost everything out, so the job was gone. Her backup plan for that was, once again, to marry Chad.  So she got knocked up a second time. Chad again declined to marry her.

So mom and daughter hatched a plan, and got some support from the local church. They set up a 'surprise wedding' to try to push Chad into 'manning up.' They had the makeshift building the church was in due to damage to the actual church all decked out, a wedding dress, and the works. So she lured Chad up there and sprung this on him. His reaction to being told what was going on was apparently 'Fuck that!' followed by a quick exit.

Chad promptly skipped town after that. I can't say I blame him on that. Imagine walking into a place like that, complete with a small crowd, and some whiteknight trying to put pressure on you. It'd be bewildering and scary at the same time. 

The consensus at the pea shelling was surprisingly even handed, though. Mostly that Chad is a thug, and he is, but that the majority of it is her fault for trying to trap him. Grandma went on at length about how upset she was about the whole thing.

Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here. She's hated my wife since the moment wife and I met so I honestly don't know if she's a good person to talk about this to or if she's telling me what she thinks I want to hear. The only other person I've talked to about this is my sister and she thinks we should go back to couple's therapy. Friend told me what to expect from this sub and I've been lurking for a few days; for the sake of writing I'm going to refer to my wife as ""her"", because I don't want to accidentally call her 'him' offline -that's not pleasant for anyone the occasional time I slip up. 

Call her whatever you like when you reply, she's not going to see it and I have other things to think about. 

My wife is a trans woman and came to terms with it three years ago. Told me, started transitioning and all that. I love her. This wasn't a deal breaker and we talked to a couple's therapist and honestly everything was fine except for a few issues around my pregnancy and then our newborn. (Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)). 

We both work full time, and the budgets tight. Neither of us have a degree and we both only make a little more then minimum wage. We weren't perfect financially before our second child was born, but things weren't so tight.

I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras that I got with my first pregnancy after I outgrew my other bras. I don't wear makeup besides a bit of mascara and colored lip-gloss, and my skin care routine is simple as is my hair routine (I cut it myself and don't dye it or anything). I'm low maintenance  partially because I can't justify buying myself a new cheap bra when that $20 could go to our debt or something the kids need or something the kids want and partially because I don't feel like I need to wear a ton of makeup or stuff like that.  

My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.
 
We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs. 

I was fine with it all at first; writing this off as part of the costs of transition. I realize now though, that my wife is not going to *stop* racking up credit card debt for these things she thinks she needs. I go without, because I don't feel as though anything I want like a new bra is that needed for the family to incur more debt or to pay off that less debt that month. 

Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there. 

She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would *help* because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it. 

She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores. 

Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace came off her bra, thinking to myself ""I could have fixed it, come on, there's no need to act like this. And why is she so upset when she has four times the amount of bras then I do and hers are all much nicer than mine?"" Then I wondered why the hell I was doing her laundry, my laundry, and our children's laundry? She never does laundry.

She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't handle that. She called her friends in so there was a friend of hers at our home with them the *entire* time. By the way, she completely dropped all of her old friends and now the only friends she has are also trans women or non-binary or whatever. So that was a fun conversation to have because I only know like two of her friends well enough to babysit my children and she can't possibly know everyone to know they're safe to have around our kids. I got called transphobic for that one, by the way. She apologized, but the very fact that's what she jumped on instead of my concerns about who is in close contact with our kids? And maybe I'm paranoid, but I was molested as a child by a family friend which she *knows*. 


Oh, and her friends...besides the two I know, everyone else just aren't very nice to me if we at a gathering or host a party. I'm treated like the help instead of the cohost. Most of them have no interest in getting to know me or even talking to me and are on the edge of rude. She doesn't see it. 

I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything.  It honestly wasn't this bad when she was my husband. 

A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper city to live where we would buy a house. 

Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave""

Which stung, by the way. My current employer had me back at work three weeks after our 3 year old was born. They claimed there was an issue somewhere along the way and if I wanted to keep my job I needed to come back that soon. Probably not legal, but I was in no position to find out for sure. 

I told her that if we have the money for one of us to go back to school and stay at home with a baby, it's going to be ME. And brought up how long it took for me to fully heal from giving birth when I had to work -on top of the knowledge that I was missing out on time with our newborn. 

So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her, and how *she* felt watching me while I was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or of knowing she could never be pregnant and on and on and how another baby that she did the majority of care for would be her chance to be a real mother. And I ended up tuning her out, wondering if she's always been this selfish and self centered or if it was new. The conversation ended with us deciding to talk about it closer to my birthday. 

Maybe it's me, I don't know, but hearing her talk about having maternity leave when I was the one who would be giving birth, dealing with all that comes with that made me angry, really honestly angry for the first time in a long time. What kind of partner would be so callous? And it dawned on me that we aren't really in a real partner ship any more. I love her, but that's just not enough any more.

2503,"If you read my post history, I went to rehab around 6 months ago to get off of an opioid. I've been reading through this subreddit more and more and I decided I wanted to share my experience. 

Places for drug rehabilitation are strictly divided up by male and female for obvious reasons, but men who claim to identify as woman can literally get away with working in close proximity to very vulnerable women who are stuck in their beds. There were three TIMS who worked in the women's ward, one was a counselor, cook, and a nurse. To put it into perspective, there were only around 15-20 women in the ward at any given time including the employees and those in recovery. The only male you would be allowed to see (aside from the tims) would be the doctor who would prescribe meds. 

When you're going through detox, you have a night shift nurse who wakes you up a few times to check vitals. I was a bit afraid at times when I woke up that my night shift nurse got switched to the trans one who only worked for the day. The trans nurse was like the cook, over 6 ft tall and very unmistakably male. 

One of my concerns is they let TIMS in as patients (one of the woman in my group was a tif who I felt comfortable around), because otherwise you'll be trapped in a dark room unable to move due to withdrawals with a male right beside you. That's a nightmare scenario right there and I'm really glad I only had to deal with my roommate snoring loud. Given that they already allow them to work very closely with vulnerable women, I wouldn't say it's too far fetched that they would accept that.

2505,"I remember back when i was a libfem that I would constantly hear that being transracial isn?t okay because racial oppression leaves legacies and intergenerational trauma, whereas gender supposedly didn?t.

I?ve been thinking about that, and I... really don?t think that?s true. I absolutely believe that people from marginalized ethnicities and races have these legacies- ie not having access to large inheritance because of not getting to inherit the wealth of their ancestors, because those ancestors were slaves, barred from employment on the basis of their race, and economically shunned for their race, etc.

But I think women face similar legacies. The obvious ones being trauma- we inherit the internalized misogyny of our mothers. Like when mothers from the Middle East try to marry off their daughters when they are literal children because they were also married off young, when mothers want FGM for their daughters... for less severe cases like my mother, she passed on ideas of my being inherently stupid and useless on the basis of my sex (ie telling me girls can only pass tests if they cheat), and passing her body image issues on to me (telling me by age 13 I needed multiple plastic surgeries to look okay). So of course, I grew up with super low self esteem, thinking I was stupid, worthless, and ugly.

On more structural terms of wealth, I remember reading that women tend to get less inheritance then their male siblings. I can?t remeber the source, but at the very least I know this is true for the country my mother is from, and my grandpa said allah told him his son should get the wealth and not his daughters. 

This is ESPECIALLY visible in the workplace. All the higher paying jobs- execs, CEOs, tech, finance- are complete boys clubs who pick their own. It?s so hard for women to break in especially because of how unwelcoming and hostile it is to us. And even if it wasn?t, they are much more likely to choose fellow men. From when women first weren?t allowed to work to when they just started getting that right, men had already started their boys clubs. It was their forefathers who had these jobs, and who passed it onto men. It?s the same thing as the inheritance- except rather than passing the torch to just their blood sons, it is just to the next younger generation of men.

I am writing this because someone here might need to hear it. Because SO many women experience miscarriages, and yet it's this unspoken understanding between us. Chances are that MANY of your female loved ones have gone through this (or even you), but have you ever talked about it? Even if you did not want to have a baby, it is still an extremely traumatic experience. Why, as women, do we feel we need to carry this pain alone? Why are we ashamed to talk about it? Why does our society force us into dark corners and small rooms to talk about such things? **WOMEN'S SPACES MATTER!**

When I was looking for stories of other women's experiences, there were so few, and usually they were from a Christian perspective (and usually from the perspective of women who wanted a baby). That is so not me. I've never told the story 100% to anyone, though I did share that it happened with friends and family because I wanted anyone who needed to know this that she is not alone. A LOT of women responded to my story with their own story. Miscarriage, whether or not a child is desired, is a tragic and traumatic event. Physically, emotionally, spiritually, etc. It changes you mentally (and physically). 

Years ago, I was living a pretty unhealthy lifestyle working graveyard shifts at a very shitty job. I was a big drinker at the time. (More than three years without a drop of alcohol today; yay!) I was drinking to get my mind off the pain of my job and my life, and the emptiness that I felt (who CAN'T relate to this?).

One day, I got this feeling. Out of nowhere. I literally SENSED that I was pregnant. I can't describe it other than I suddenly *knew* I was pregnant. At no point (except at the doctor after my miscarriage) did I take a pregnancy test. Learn from my mistakes. I avoided it until I could no longer avoid it.

I did not want to be pregnant, at all. No part of me wanted to be a mother. I was terrified. I did not want to deal with the situation whatsoever. So I decided to go into denial. But in the back of my mind, I knew. I started ""hypothetically"" looking up ways to ""deal"" with the issue, even though I had money and access to a clinic that could have assisted me in getting an abortion. I didn't want to confront it.

I found this old website, called [Sister Zeus](http://www.sisterzeus.com/List.htm) (mods, please let me know if I need to take this down due to subject matter), which had a lot of naturopathic advice on fertility, contraceptives, etc. I considered eating fuck tons of parsley to give myself an abortion, before deciding that the risks were simply too great. ""Why are you doing all this?"" I asked myself. **Because I was scared and alone.** ""You're probably wrong and not actually pregnant anyway."" Doubting my innate knowledge of my body as a woman. Society has trained us to do so. 

There is a section on there about [visualizations](http://www.sisterzeus.com/vis_list.html), which (in this context) are basically meditations or attempts to communicate with goddesses, other beings, etc. Reading them brought some comfort to me, and one of them was a visualization to [communicate with your baby](http://www.sisterzeus.com/vis_withbaby.html) (as a woman who was seeking an abortion). 

Me, being a total atheist, but also totally desperate... I closed my eyes, relaxed, and ""communicated"" with my ""baby."" I told it that I was not ready to be a mother. I was not responsible enough. I did not want that. I wanted its soul to stay up in the heavens/Olympus/purgatory/paradise/nirvana/wherever, for a little while longer. Or maybe forever. I begged and pleaded and apologized, feeling completely insane and desperate. *I'm not ready. I don't want to have a baby.* I cried. 

I was so scared.

***I am going to get graphic here. So few miscarriage stories explain the gory details but women need to know what this entails. We need to be prepared and aware.***

A few nights later, I became very tired and took a nap on the couch. Then I woke up in complete agony late at night, around 1:00a.m. My stomach was killing me. It felt like the worst period ever, but there was this intermittent pulsing feeling. I immediately realized that that was a contraction. I knew for sure that I was pregnant now, and didn't want to believe it, but could no longer run away from the truth.  

I went to the restroom and there was blood EVERYWHERE. I have never seen so much blood in one place. I wondered if I actually was not pregnant and was just internally bleeding and about to die. Also, many bowel movements were happening at the same time. I see now why people warn pregnant women that they may take a shit on the table. 

I was crying and in pain and scared. At this point, I finally woke my male partner up and explained to him that I was pretty sure I was having a miscarriage. He did not want to believe it either. I had never mentioned any of this to him. It just felt like it was between me and my body and I didn't want to bring a man into it.

This was going on for hours. Three, I think. I wanted it to just end. I never considered going to the hospital because Google had said that it usually wasn't necessary for miscarriages. (I'm not advocating for approaching the situation this way, just explaining what I did.)

At some point, I had this overwhelming urge to get into the bath. I filled a bath up and got in it. It immediately turned dark red. It looked like a suicide attempt. I felt a little better, though, but I was still in serious pain and the contractions were happening faster and faster. It occurred to me that, if I was standing, maybe gravity would help move things along. So, I turned on a warm shower and stood underneath it. Blood was running down my legs, all over the bathtub, there was a strange smell of... birth? Pregnancy? I don't know, one I did not recognize. Coming from my body. I was crying and having a hard time processing what was going on. 

All of the sudden, I felt something much larger than any period discharge give way and come out of me in a rush. I screamed. The... fetus, baby, mass of cells, whatever it was, came out of me. I ""gave birth,"" or whatever. 

I jumped out of the bathtub. I couldn't face it. I couldn't look at the life that I begged to leave me. I told my husband I would clean it up, but I couldn't do it. I ran out of the room crying, with many pads in my underwear because I was still bleeding a lot (I did not wear tampons for a VERY long time after this). He ended up picking up the organism, washing it off and looking at it. I never looked at it. I asked him once what it looked like, a long time later, and he said it looked like a small triangle, and not a baby.

After that, I went to sleep.

The next morning I called a gynecologist that I hadn't seen in years, explaining that I had a miscarriage and I needed to be checked out. When I said ""miscarriage,"" they immediately found a spot in their schedule for me later in the day, even though they were usually booked out awhile. I brought myself to go. The doctors were all very polite; nobody apologized for my loss or anything like that, but they were gentle with me. I finally got a pregnancy test. I was, indeed, pregnant. The doctor assessed (not sure how) that I was at about 18-20 weeks. He said that, based on my description of how the event happened, the fetus was likely never going to be viable no matter what I did. Basically, he wanted to preempt any thoughts I may have had that it was ""my fault."" (Not that it worked, though looking back, I feel neutral about this situation. I do not carry guilt.) He said I may need to go in one day to get a D&C if the miscarriage did not expel all of the tissue, but that ended up not being necessary.

I called my boss and explained what happened and he gave me one day off. Awesome! (Fucking asshole.)

That is the story of my miscarriage. 

I sometimes wonder a little about the visualizations. Am I being naive by being an atheist? Was I actually communing with some spiritual being who heeded my call to not let me have a baby? Why would I get what I wanted, but other women in worse situations still have a baby? Or women who want children find themselves unable to do so? How does it all work? Is it all completely arbitrary?

2 that defining men and women by any other criterion (genitals, chromosomes, socialisation, appearance etc) is transphobic.

Feminists recognise that we live in a culture where there is an epidemic of men who are sexist to women. Men (as a collective);

(ii) different from the ways women treat women.

And,

(Iii) both (I) and (ii) need to be explained if women hope to emancipate themselves from sexism. 


This is something all feminists (even liberal feminists) recognise. People who fail to recognise this usually call themselves 'humanists' , 'egalitarians' 'liberals' or just 'MRAs'.

To explain sexism feminists could attempt to build a story that casually connects things like chromosomes, hormones, or socialisation with the prevalence of sexist behaviour in men. 

However if we blamed men's sexist behaviour on chromosomes, hormones, or socialisation then we are saying that what exists in men that makes them sexist (and justifies feminist criticism, action, and segregation from them) also exists in ""transwomen"". As far as the feminist project is concerned this would make many transwomen indistinguishable from men. To explain the behaviour of transwomen we would say that they are men and thereby contradict their identy claims. 

[Note: any transactivists who admits that they had male privilege, or were socialised as a man has already contradicted their own identy claims]

The only way the transactivism and feminism could be compatible is if we blamed sexism on the fact that men ""identify as"" men (that is to say that they believe they are men or feel like men). Referencing any other type of explanation for men's sexism would necessarily import a transphobia into feminist theory.

However, we know that socialisation and biology do play a role in behaviour. We also know that whatever the explanation for men's sexist behaviour is, it will be more complicated than 'men are sexist towards women because they feel like men she believe they are men'.

The only way for feminist theory to not be transphobic is for us to neglect to investigate the most promising explanations of sexism.

It absolutely does not characterize my feelings about gender in any way. I do not identify with women?s oppression or femininity. Rather, I feel those things are imposed on an unwilling me by society. 

I think the better way to describe myself and many so-called ?cis? people is that we?re gender integrated. 

I have taken all the aspects of me that are stereotypically feminine combined them with the traits and interests that are stereotypically masculine and have created one personality.

That personality happens to reside in a female body, thus I am merely female. It doesn?t matter how I present, people will still see me as female. 

Gender-integration is how normal people deal with aspects of themselves that aren?t stereotypical for their gender and I think it?s the optimum treatment for people with gender dysphoria.

Instead of changing their identities on ID, I think they should be counselled into accepting themselves as they are.

So you?re a man who likes dresses, makeup and heels. So what? Integrate those preferences into your manhood. Make wearing a dress an acceptable masculine endeavour. This is why I support men who admit they?re men but like cross dressing?they?re honest about themselves, they?re honest about why they cross dress and they own their manhood. 

After all, I can integrate my love of sports, power tools, politics, gaming, technology, jogging pants, running shoes, sweatshirts?all stereotypical male interests?into my femininity so why can?t some men integrate their feminine interests into their masculinity?

It all comes back to misogyny and the desire to gatekeep masculinity by refusing to let feminine things gain popularity among men. Look at how women are better able to branch out into masculine endeavours but men are still constrained by rigid expectations of manhood.

It?s only when men allow the stereotypically  feminine to become acceptable for men that women can achieve equality.

TiMs have rigid world views about what makes a man and what makes a woman; they think there?s something wrong about a person who tries to live beyond their gender roles. They think it?s so wrong that they can?t tolerate themselves as men with feminine interests so they try to live as women instead.

If these TiMs didn?t view femininity as weak and pathetic, they would be happy to integrate their femininity into their masculinity.

That?s why gender integration should be the goal. Trans people should receive robust education about gender stereotypes and the harm they cause and learn to accept themselves as they are. 

When I was a child, we were taught that girls could do boy things and boys could do girl things. Girls quickly seized on this and began doing boy things but boys didn?t because they have been trained to see femininity as negative. 

In truth though, most men accept the feminine parts of themselves and just integrate it into their manhood.

I've worked on cases where fathers did not want their daughters to undergo FGM but their mothers enforced this, a few times even without the father's knowledge. 

I have had cases in the past where a new bride's mother in law will treat her like absolute shit, one of these cases involved actually locking her in a room for hours on end and starving her because she had not done all the ironing in the home. Of course, the husband rarely sides with his wife, always acting like his mother can do no fucking harm, but sometimes the wife's own mother won't even accept her back or take her side.

She wants the kids to go to a certain school? Done! She even has ultimate veto power over all our names when children are born. As the oldest living relative in our line, she commands a huge amount of authority... but of course uses it to reinforce gender roles completely, completely fawning over the men whilst criticising their wives for never being good enough, for not cooking more, etc. I see women in my family then raising *their* sons this way, fawning over them whilst treating their daughters like some kind of servant, and of course when their sons get married their wives are treated as being totally disposable, just another cook/cleaner which he can replace if she angers him.

I know that a lot of women have internalised misogyny, and I know that it is men who rape, kill and assault women at horrific levels worldwide. This angers me.

We mean it literally, following directly from their own descriptions of being misgendered.  

It is often described as this: Being ?misgendered? reminds the person that they are not and will never be the opposite sex and that triggers extreme sadness and disgust at that fact (and at their body for being the way it is that that fact is true) aka dysphoria.  We can accept that this might be true.

Later, I heard that he hit on every popular girl (and the ones considered the nicest) by sending his male friends to ask them if they would date him. All of them said no and they hated this way of asking. 

I was personally very shy, some considered me ugly, and I preferred manly clothes, didn't use makeup etc. (I was really looked down for it in general.) I heard some boys teasing ""the incel guy"" that he should hit on me, because ""we would fit""... He took that as a great insult, probably that's why he hated me. (He said that he hates me.)


Until like 11th grade I thought he was like this only with me. Until I heard a girl saying that he hates her and she doesn't know why. This girl was also rather less feminine and a little bit overweight too.

It took me years to figure out that there must be something up with this person's fragile male ego (his extremw homophobia is an indicator). Is it common for ""incels"" to hate on girls without reason who are considered less attractive? When I say incel, I'm not sure I'm using the accurate word, but I mean boys who feel rejected.",0,1556300842.0,bhp8co,29,GenderCritical

I don't just want a 10-second shot of all the female (mostly secondary) characters together. That does not make up for the fact that with all this build-up, Marvel has only done one movie with a female lead. Do they think we won't see through that, that we'll be satisfied with that little moment because it will make us forget that our characters have been sidekicks in almost every movie? Honestly, I personally would rather they not pander like that and either give us movies starring our heroes or just let it be. What they did only gives ammunition to the male fans who complain about forced diversity.

And if I'm remembering right, the way they did it was actually kind of an insult. (I've only seen the movie once, so someone please correct me if my memory is wrong. And again, major spoiler alert.) So on this huge battlefield, the heroes are trying to keep the Infinity Gauntlet away from Thanos. It's kind of like a keep-away game, with it being passed from hero to hero. Eventually, it's decided that Captain Marvel should take it. Before passing it off, the male hero says something like, ""Okay, but I don't know how you're going to get it all the way over there."" Cue moment of all the women standing together, and one of them says something like, ""Don't worry, she won't be alone.""

2553,"So the gist of the original story is that a man twice my age approached me in a parking lot because he wanted to talk about the cool car I was driving. I made some small talk with him about it, and then I tried to leave. He got really sexual and I made it clear I was a 17 year old and NOT interested in him. I made it explicitly clear. I also told him I had a boyfriend (which I did). He told me he was in his 30s and that I needed to try out an older man because he saw nothing wrong with me being 17. He said it wasn?t fair that I looked so much older. He asked me about 4 different ways for my number. He tried to get me to get in his car to ?go for a ride?. I told him that I didn?t like it, and my dad and boyfriend sure as hell wouldn?t. Anyway, it just escalated and he just kept begging for me to ?give him a chance? and he got creepier and more sexual. I got home that night and found him on Instagram and Facebook and found that he has several small children, including daughters, and a girlfriend. I blocked him on all platforms just to be safe. Never once was I a tease. He was the one who got gross really fast and wanted to talk about everything but cars. 

So I was pretty shaken up by the whole encounter and I thought I could get some support over on 2x chromosomes because I figured they supported young girls who look way older who get preyed on by older men. Boy was I wrong. I don?t think one female commented, it was just a barrage of attacks from men. Claiming that it?s not their fault that I?m in my sexual prime and it?s just human nature to be sexually attracted to almost legal girls. They said I was a tease and I had no right to be upset by the encounter. They said nothing would?ve happened. It was all my fault apparently. Then the ?NoT aLl MeN? comments came. It turned into such a charlie foxtrot that I just deleted whole entire post.

2555,"I?m writing this because of another woman?s post the other day here about her boyfriend?s pornography addiction because it reminded me of how much I struggled with past boyfriends? pornography use and how much that warped my perception of myself, of men and women. I don?t feel like there are many spaces on reddit where I can actually speak about this, but I believe this is a place where I can (or at least I hope I can). 

To preface, I?m a heterosexual woman and I?m multi racial (like really mixed up), but I pretty much look like I?m half Asian and Hispanic (I?m not Hispanic, but whatever). I mention this because it?s relevant to the porn thing. 

So, I was partially raised by my abusive biological mother until I was sort of unofficially adopted by a former teacher and her family when I was 13. My biological mom was a stereotypical ?man hater? ? she had been severely sexually and physically abused by her father as a child, so naturally she really didn?t have the best views about men or people more generally. I?m not going to delve into how she was abusive to me much (she?s a narcissist) because it isn?t relevant to this, but I was basically raised to believe that men were either predators or abusers or absolute dogs. That all men were hotly sexually wired to the point where they could never be satisfied with just one woman (regardless of how beautiful she was), that they would always have to look to external means to satisfy their urges, and that this was perfectly natural and that if I wasn?t comfortable with it I was just being insecure. ?Good? men didn?t cheat on their wives or girlfriends, instead they used porn to satisfy themselves and again, this was all perfectly natural and something that I would just have to accept. This was all normal and natural. 

My problem? I could never accept it. The thing is, I WAS insecure ? I was a model, I was mixed race, I struggled with body dysmorphia, gender dysphoria at times and I had a severe eating disorder for years. I was able to recognize all of these insecurities and I tried (and still try) to overcome them, but the only ?insecurity? I really couldn?t rationalize or treat was my ?insecurity? with my boyfriends using porn. I always thought to myself, ?if I can be satisfied with only him, why can he never be satisfied with just me?? Some might laugh at this, but I used to wish I was a lesbian because I seriously believed that only women were truly capable of being trustworthy, committed and sexually honest.

I just wanted to be enough. I never felt enough in so many ways, intellectually and physically, and as I tried to battle my own issues I still could never reach that part where I was genuinely okay with my boyfriend using porn. It was deeply upsetting. When I was 18, I was in a relationship with a guy who was also my best friend, and I have no doubt that he loved me, but he couldn?t stop his porn use. Specifically, he was obsessed with black and Asian porn, which made me feel even more uncomfortable (I was always like, you get the *real* thing and that still doesn?t work?) He genuinely believed that I shouldn?t have had a problem with him watching porn, and that once I worked more on my sense of self worth that we would move past this and it would no longer be a problem. Well, it didn?t work. We were together for three years.

I dated other men. A lot of them had an Asian fetish, thought I was ?exotic? for being mixed, only watched WoC porn and only dated WoC so they thought they weren?t racist (readers here probably know who I mean), etc. I could never really connect, and I greatly struggled with maintaining romantic connections because the ?porn? issue always came up. And if it wasn?t porn, it was some other way of objectifying women that turned me off.

Eventually, I met a man and he was, shockingly, not like ?men.? He didn?t watch porn. He didn?t objectify women. He didn?t objectify women of color. He was legitimately a regular human and he treated me like a real person. This relationship also didn?t last, but I think it?s important to mention because it was a real turning point for me and made me question some deeply sick, misogynistic beliefs that I had held about men and women for so long. I thought, ?if this guy exists, and he doesn?t use porn, and he?s not sexually repressed and is for all intents and purposes a well adjusted human being... maybe I?ve been living a lie??

And I had been. I had been living this lie that all men were perverted and that women absolutely had to put up with their shit because they couldn?t ?fix? their biology, and to take away their porn would be crazy and abusive. I lived with that lie for 24 years. I lived with this lie that EVERYONE was a certain way, and that I just had to accept it and that there was something deeply wrong with me for not accepting it. Turns out, I and the people who told me these things were full of shit. A lot of shit.

The thing is, men and people are not hardwired to want/need to fuck everything that walks. Men who respect women and their partners do not need to satisfy their ?extra sexual? urges with pornography or other erotic materials. That is a lie. You do not have to change yourself to fit into this narrative. As I got older, I met plenty of other folks who had been in the same boat and with enough experience began to realize that this was all bullshit, too. There are men out there who will want you and only you because they are secure in themselves and in their sexuality and you are enough. You shouldn?t have to put up with anything else.

I realize this was kind of a ramble, but I wanted to post this because I genuinely feel empathy for the girl who made that post about her boyfriend the other day. What he is doing to her is not natural, should not be accepted, and should not be taught to future boys or girls. Pornography is a symptom of a sick society that does not value women nor healthy, fulfilling relationships for women (or men, for that matter). 

Currently, I?m in a relationship with another man who has zero interest in porn, knows that it?s exploitation of women, doesn?t use porn and we have a healthy sex life and I am genuinely happy with this. It is still hard for me at times to accept that not all men are massive porn addicts or are secretly pining for sex from other women, but I do know the truth now and life is a lot better because of it. I seriously only wish the best for those who are currently struggling with porn addicted partners, or porn addiction themselves.

2556,"So I'm a TIF, and I do plan on transitioning as after several years of repressing, I realised that transitioning is going to be best for my dysphoria. However, I really hate the trans community and I want to separate myself from it entirely. The amount of violence and abuse TIFs will get from TIMs is disgusting, and what's worse is no one will do anything about it.

My experience with this was being groomed by a TIM quite a bit older than me after I left my abusive home situation and was very clearly vulnerable. They always pressured me into doing sexual shit with them, and one time sexually assaulted and tbh almost raped me while I was asleep, after they had got me very drunk. When I tried to tell people about this, I was labelled a transmisogynist because TIMs are more oppressed than TIFs, and I somehow had male privilege over this person, despite me clearly not holding any privilege that a male would have as I am female bodied, and seen as female in society. People even went as far to say that this person meant no harm, but they have a history of this sort of behaviour towards vulnerable female people.

Unfortunately, this isn't an uncommon thing. There's so many abusive TIMs in the community, and they're usually high up. TIFs can't do anything about it because we're labelled as having a position of power over them (we don't) and that we're exactly the same as cis men (we aren't.) After taking a lot of time to think about this, I am sure this is rooted in misogyny. It disgusts me that these people hold so much power and abuse it.

Because of this, I have decided to be a whole lot less open about being trans, and I'm avoiding the community as a whole.

So, I don't really belive in trans anything, first because I truly belive that if we lived in a world without gender stereotypes (as I want and preach), we wouldn't have anyone claiming to be transgender, and second that I think that any dysmorphia is a disease and should be treated as one. We can't say a gir with anorexia it's not fine and then accept other things.

It's been clear to me and this other friend that he is not secure in he's decision to start transitioning, specifically, as our culture basically demands, he lives with his father THAT DOES NOT KNOW, and he said he's not going to tell his father, that he plan to simply start transitioning and that his dad will have to confront him or he wont tell, cuz he feel that he can't tell him. I keep thinking how would that work, as he start growing a beard out of nowhere while living with his strict christian active military man, that presumed that his daughter was a butch lesbian as they never talked about it, anything. Basically this kid is raising himself, so he doesn't have enough real life experience or maturity, you know? Me and this other friend, basically the only people that he really talks about this trans things, have a habit to misgender anyone and everyone, I've have been know to misgender myself and even my husband, that is so usual with me, that my highly homophobic FIL (that type that would make hell break lose if someone says anything about him being a manly man and straight) doesn't care anymore when I do it... But not him, if I say 7 gendered(?) adjectives for him, and ONE OF SEVEN is feminine, he gets midly offended and corrects me. He even decided to not use the free treatment for """"""""reassignment"""""""" my country government offers, because that would mean that he would have mandatory therapy, and he does not want to have anyone asking if he's sure he's trans, he prefers to pay out of pocket with a money he does not have so he skip out on therapy.
And how is this all my problem you ask?

*Should a person who feels his legal age does not correspond with his experienced age be allowed to change his legal age? In this paper, I argue that in some cases people should be allowed to change their legal age. Such cases would be when: 1) the person genuinely feels his age differs significantly from his chronological age and 2) the person?s biological age is recognized to be significantly different from his chronological age and 3) age change would likely prevent, stop or reduce ageism, discrimination due to age, he would otherwise face. I also consider some objections against the view that people should be allowed to change their legal age and find them lacking.*

It occurred to me today that several times when I've tried to network with men it has ended badly and I've lost out on work opportunities and have been sexually harassed instead. It got me thinking, this must happen to women everywhere. And that means women's careers everywhere are being stunted by men doing this to them. My examples are:

&#x200B;

1. I went on a work related workshop and asked the man running it if his company had any vacancies in my particular field. He said he thought they might and said he could pass my details onto the hiring manager so I gave him my phone number. He was really encouraging about my work and was an educated 'left wing' man who is much respected in his community so I didn't think twice about giving him my information. We also shared some mutual contacts. A few days later he started texting me saying how great my work was and did I want to meet up to go to another industry related event. I agreed before realising it seemed date-like then politely declined. He then kept messaging me and invited me out 6 more times for meals and to concerts (ie. not work related) and even sent post to my address which he accessed from his company database. He told me that he had 'never met a woman like me before' and made it clear he wanted to date. I had to tell him to stop contacting me and of course lost out on work  opportunities at his workplace which I would have really liked to do.
2. I went to this restaurant on my own in the daytime and brought some of my work. I'd been a few times before and the male owner seemed ok. One time he was there with some of his friends and they asked me about my work. We had a chat about it and the owner said he knew someone in my industry who might have an opportunity. So I left my number. He then started texting me saying that I looked like a certain celebrity and invited me to go to his restaurant after closing. Yuck, yuck yuck. Another potential work opportunity lost plus I now avoid going anywhere near that restaurant (although I'm starting to think these opportunities are none existent and just an excuse to get a phone number).
3. Years ago I was matched with an older male mentor by an organisation. He set up a meeting with a company he knew. They liked my work but tried to persuade me to work for free. They all referred to the talented and professional women in their office as 'girls.' It had a really sexist atmosphere and I felt uncomfortable. I told them that I don't work for free and all of them including the mentor were angry with me and told me I was making a mistake. I ended the mentorship and found a female mentor instead who agreed with me that it was totally exploitative of them to expect free work. But it meant another work opportunity lost as this was a huge firm plus just a big waste of time.
4. I did an internship and the manager promised to pay for my travel and food (no salary). He conveniently forgot until I ended up writing to him demanding it. This guy was absolutely loaded driving round in a really expensive car and he spent hardly any time in the office. The work he tried to get me to do was unethical. I left feeling very disappointed, exploited and lied to, yet again.
5. In a past job I was given a promotion over this man who worked there. People used to take it in turns to make the team coffee. Whenever it was his turn he never asked me if I wanted a drink and used to make coffee for everyone except me when I always made him coffee alongside everyone else. I found this to be remarkably petty and bitter behaviour.

&#x200B;

I have had trouble with various women I've worked with too, so I'm under no impression we are all angels in the slightest. But one thing they don't do is stalk and harass me and try to get me to date them. I've been to a women's networking event and it was so much better. Genuinely great, talented and supportive women. I think it's the only way forward because too many men see the phone number or email address of a woman as an invitation to harass her for sexual involvement or they see her as free or cheap labour. It's made me realise that we really haven't advanced that much as a society and in many ways and women are still held back loads in apparently modern westernised society.

Sometimes I just feel like giving up of everything. I live in a state where people tend to be really misogynistic in general and I honestly think it's too much for me. At all times I just feel like I am about to have a breakdown. I have no friends, I really try to make friends but most men will only talk about sex, prostitutes and other things when I am around. And the women, for the most part, are really protective of men and will not like me very much.
I know it my sound like victimization but it really isn't. I like what I am studying but I hate this environment and I think it's like this in most of the tech field or those related to it.
Is there any advice you can give me? I am starting therapy next month, but I still want to hear from women who had to deal with similar things, if it's possible to do something.
And sorry if my English isn't very good, I am really stressed and lost right now.

Fast Forward to 2016, I make a Facebook for the very first time to spy on family I haven't spoken to in years, I see my cousin, my lesbian cousin - someone who gave me strength for being out in the family whilst I was too afraid - wrapped around in a trans flag congratulating herself after a year of coming out as trans and that she's been pumping herself with testosterone for six months. I cried because it must have been hard for her, to believe she'd have to do such a thing. When I finally visited, her and her girlfriend bombarded me with questions about my sexual preference and gender identity. I refused to answer because why the fuck should I? A year later, she rushes into top surgery, saying she would die if she didn't get it, and even joked about the fact that breast cancer runs in our family, and said ""Luckily, I'm fully a man now,""

&#x200B;

Now, I wished at the time that I replied with the fact that her mutilated chest can still contract breast cancer, and that she will soon go on to mutilate her vagina for a blow-up penis, but I simply wasn't knowledgeable enough, and shrugged off her ""joke."" For a Biology major, she wasn't very smart (or was either extremely deluded), so just a few months ago, I wished her the best in life and stopped talking to her.

In my highschool, there are a lot of TIFs, and a lot of them are younger than me. They tend to all like me, after all, I respect their pronouns easily and never ask questions, and when they ask me questions I never answer or state my opinion. If I have to, it's a bullshit one at best. The one I currently know is only 16 and constantly goes on and on about being trans, calling me and her other friends, who say nothing about her behavior, ""cis"" like it's nobody's business. She constantly rambles about getting top surgery, passing, and gay, gay, gay like that's all her personality is accountable for. 

&#x200B;

I hang out with mostly men, so she decided to come along to freeload off of us. It was two of my friends (both very docile and calm men) and her. As we were walking to the local ice cream parlor, she decided to ""honk"" one of my breasts. Naturally, I twisted her wrist and told her to back the fuck off. She proceeded to back up and look at my two friends stating that it was a manly thing to do and the two of them made her feel like she passed. I wish I could say that they were equally as pissed off as me, but they weren't. They both remained quiet for the whole gathering, and later on told me they were afraid of being labelled as transphobic or ""TERFs"". ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

&#x200B;

THAT WAS THE FINAL FUCKING STRAW.

I didn't know anything about gender critical feminism. I didn't know what most, if not all, TRAs stand for: death upon women who held different opinions than them, for women's spaces and rights to be invaded, for words and biology to be redefined so everyone can suit their needs, and for fucking children, fucking children for god's sake, to mutilate their young, developing bodies and minds to 'transition' when they're children who are exploring their very being. 

&#x200B;

It got even worse when I further noticed celebrities, charities, politicians, people with huge platforms, millions and millions of followers, endorsing this nonsense, only ever showcasing the ""positive"" and afraid to delve deeper into the negative, afraid to realize that Trans Rights only bring biological women several steps backwards. Even ""scientists"" and ""doctors"" endorse this shit, so they can freely experiment. 

&#x200B;

I see people promoting cosmetic surgery, giving away their money to beggars and charities that benefit these mentally ill people, who honestly think if they don't receive surge they'll die, and now there are even people who state they're trans, but won't ever transition. Just trans, just because there is nothing special about them.

&#x200B;

And for the girls and boys who are lost about their identities, I can only hope they don't fall for this bullshit. I can only hope that this is the new goth, emo, grunge, or scene, but only time will tell, since they've gotten a tight grasp on Liberal and Democratic politics.

&#x200B;

I wish that TRAs would just realize that being different, not conforming to your gender, does not mean Trans anything, and that you shouldn't have to go to extreme lengths to be something you're not.

&#x200B;

That liking biological sex is a thing, and tricking people into thinking you're something that you're not is wrong. Period.

&#x200B;

Whether the person is male or female, they'll forever be just that, but they do not have to conform to the backwards thinking of femininity for females and masculinity for males, and that not every single little thing needs a neat little label slapped onto it.

2661,"My parents have been telling me that my life's purpose is to have children ever since I was born (or so it feels like). A few years ago, I had been through absolute hell because my mom was desperate for grandchildren (she now has a grandson from one of my younger sisters). I grew up in a place in which most women become mothers at 20-22, and the general attitude is that you're not supposed to start having kids later because then you can't have as many kids. 

I'm now almost 24, and while I do not officially declare myself childfree (nor do I have any children), the expectation for women to have children has pretty much ruined my life. I don't want to go into too much detail, but I was harassed and emotionally abused and name called because I didn't want to have children at an early age. 

I was arguing with some anti-choice people a while back, and at one point one of them said: ""Women's mental health doesn't matter."" That really hurt because that's pretty much what my parents said to me (both if them are officially pro-choice but that didn't stop them) and what I have been taught growing up in my community. They told me that my current happiness doesn't matter because I'll be even more unhappy in the future if I don't have kids immediately. 

And I have an anti-choice coworker who frequently says ""those women can just give their kids up for adoption."" The fact that some women have zero sympathy when it comes to other women disturbs me. She's basically saying, ""She doesn't have to raise the child against her will, but she has to give birth against her will.""

I was also taught growing up that it's ""selfish"" to not want children. I'm sorry, but I think it's a lot more ""selfish"" to pressure other women into having children against their will. 

And what disturbs me so much is that a lot of people who say that they're ""pro-choice"" will defend surrogacy. Like is it suddenly okay to coerce a woman into giving birth as long as you pay for it? Do they not see how messed up that is? And they say ""it's a choice"" and ""they enjoy it,"" but money is coercion and pregnancy is an unhealthy ""hobby,"" unlike knitting or gardening. 

A while back, I made a post on here about men who claim that men are ""attracted to signs of fertility"" and how that's bullshit since hairlessness and smooth skin aren't signs of fertility. What disturbs me is that men would start telling me these things after I would go on a body positive monologue or something. They would say ""body positivity is bullshit since men are attracted to signs of fertility."" If not meeting current beauty standards were actually a sign of infertility, wouldn't that be even more of a reason to be body positive? What these men are basically saying is: ""Your self worth is determined by your fertility and so you can't enjoy anything if it means that you're infertile."" 

I was actually crying yesterday about how women aren't allowed  to have autonomy over our reproductive systems. Even some of the most ""leftist"" (and I put ""leftist"" in quotes because they aren't real leftists) people I know will defend surrogacy. Like there's no escape from any of this. And I only covered a small fraction of the ways in which women are exploited for their reproductive systems. 

And this is part of the reason why I'm angry every single time I see TiMs with a pregnancy fetish. They will never go through what women go through because of our reproductive systems.

I thought other left, gender-critical feminists might find it buoying to see this fundamental but constantly ignored point being made about how adopting gender identity ideology undermines the validity of class analysis.

*The fact that much of the left unquestioningly accepts and regurgitates an ideology in which the subjective feelings of the individual trump objectively observable conditions is a sign that we have abandoned the physical, material reality on which our politics is based, and replaced it with a subjective individualism that is alien to any class-based analysis.*

Been lurking for a while and created a new account to post here since GC discourse is wrongthink in some of my hobby related groups and I don't want to get chucked out. I have been becoming increasingly GC over the last 6 months or so but there is one thing I am struggling to get my head around. If we accept that there is no such thing as a male or female brain, how can we justify male violence? Hormones and social conditioning etc are not independent of neurodevelopment and neural plasticity might mean that any differences are linked to that those factors rather than just XX or XY but that would still result in sex differences in adult brains right? I work in mental health with a particular interest in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and how these affect girls. When we know that there are sex differences in mental health outcomes and prevalence, in behaviors like aggression and in the behavioral expression of the same genotypes I struggle to see how there can be 0 differences across sexes.",0,1555945340.0,bg344q,34,GenderCritical

2686,"A few members in a previous post were discussing the unlikelihood of women to change ideologies from gender critical to trans positive. However, sometimes I do doubt myself.

It is generally in the face of friends, colleagues, and people I respect who consider themselves to be ""nonbinary"" to some degree. I am in a field where this is perhaps more common to encounter. But the thing is, I love these people and I want to support them. They are good people, smart people, not anyone that I would want to come into conflict with or emotionally hurt. I want these people to succeed and be happy with themselves and present as ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" as they want. And I don't think that this desire is diametrical to GCF.

But I know that if my colleagues *knew* that am GC that it would hurt them. And I wonder if it is more important to be kind and supportive or to stick to my commitment to women's liberation. I don't want it to be this clash where it must be women's rights or trans rights, I really am bothered that they collide (although, that's why we are labelled TERFs, I know). But what I come back to is the old homophobic, Christian adage of ""love the sinner, hate the sin."" This is what I feel I am doing when I am kind and affirming to transgender people in my life, but support GC causes in my private life. It makes me feel like a hypocrite and a jerk.

2687,"I've been lurking on trans/trans-dominant subs this past week. I wanted to get their side of the issue. I wanted to see if I am truly being a bigoted bitch or if there is real cause for alarm. Here's what I found:  

The best argument they had: We, GCFs, are never satisfied with how they present themselves. That if they dress in the caricature-like femme-bot way, we find it offensive and if they don't do anything to make themselves more ""feminine"" (esp. in public bathrooms) then we say ""Look the MF didn't even bother to present as a female!""  

They're absolutely right. I personally don't accept a man in a women's restroom or locker room whether or not he presents himself as ""feminine"" or not. A mother can bring her 16 yr old son in with her and I won't bat a lash, but a solo male is going to get some side-looks. What they're ignoring, other than biology and reality, is that GCFs don't acknowledge that it is possible to change one's biological sex period and that men have taught us not to trust men that go into women's bathrooms and locker rooms.  

That was the best argument I can honestly say I saw. Not once on any of the trans-dominant subs I visited did I find...  

... any consideration of actual GCF/women's concerns.  

...None of them considered how unfair it is for girls that want to participate in sports.  

...None of them considered the emotional repercussions to girls in schools that allow this bathroom/locker room nonsense.  

...None of them would even admit that it's even a little selfish to leave loopholes for sexual predators to gain easier access to traumatize women and girls just so that they can feel validated.  

...None of them even acknowledged how fucked up it is that men can self-identify as women and get awarded women's scholarships and grants.  

When they addressed specific threads on r/GenderCritical the majority of them were personal rants by people that had just recently peaked or just finding out about the whole trans movement; in other words, opinion/rant pieces where the author didn't bother with statistics or studies and were just getting shit off their chest. Low. hanging. fruit.  

I also learned that GCFs, or TERFs as they call us, are all apparently white right-wing wealthy privileged overweight socially unattractive cat ladies with no lives and just want some straw boogey man to poke at with our knitting needles.  

We apparently stalk and harass them. I personally haven't done this. I felt funny just going to their subs and reading what they said. However, I have been down-voted and harassed on subs that had nothing to do with gender nonwhatsoever by people using tagging apps.  

SUMMARY: I found no real or meaningful discussion that actually considered what gender critical feminists actually support or advocate. Instead, I found one good complaint they had against us and a mountain of baseless hatred and dehumanizing rhetoric in which they used to convince other people how hateful we are.

I never used to understand it when I would hear friends and other women say with a defeated shrug that ""all men watch porn"", as if there was something biologically inherent in men to watch thousands of naked bodies being abused on screen.

To be frank, we have a lot of problems and should probably be in therapy. But I digress. Tonight my boyfriend brought up a comment I made in a Facebook group. I was responding to a question that asked, 'What's an unpopular opinion of yours?' I said that trans-men are probably lesbians and trans-women are just dudes. I thought it was in poor taste and unnecessarily harsh without nuance, so I quickly deleted it. Or so I thought. The comment wasn't deleted and my boyfriend saw it. He brought it up to me and was extremely upset about it. I just said 'sorry I thought I deleted it' to which he responded with loaded questions. ""Is this what you really think? Do you really hate trans people?"" I just sat there in silence, quietly apologizing after he said things like ""I love you but I'm so embarrassed by you,"" and so on.

I don?t expect trans people to have to lie about their identity, and they shouldn?t, but it?s too much to ask for others to consider them the opposite sex. They should accept that they?re considered their birth sex and accept the label of non-conforming because it?s accurate. 

It?s just not realistic to expect others to consider you the opposite sex when your appearance, behaviour and history clearly show you?re not. I was reading on MtF about someone whose girlfriend doesn?t want him wearing women?s underwear and someone else commented ?it doesn?t sound like she sees you as a woman yet.? 

Well, of course she doesn?t see him as a women. Asking someone to suddenly believe their partner has changed sex upon declaration is supreme gaslighting and thus emotional abuse. 

I keep reading that TiMs find it hard to date and have relationships and it?s clear to me it?s because they?re asking their partners to participate in a fantasy role-playing game for life, and they get enraged and depressed and threaten suicide if you don?t want to do it. 

I know I?m conflating sex and gender here but isn?t that what we?re being asked to do these days? I mean we?re expected to literally consider men as women and women as men. What about non-binary people? Are we supposed to assume they have no sex whatsoever? Would that make them flat-chested or breasted? What kind of appearance are we supposed to use as a mental reference for non-binary? What does non-binary look like? How are we supposed to identify that to say it?

I have concluded we?re not supposed to be able to make these IDs and judgments on our own. 

Rather, we?re supposed to just do and say whatever trans people tell us. If TRAs say someone is female, we are just supposed to play along. Same if they say they?re male, same if they call themselves non-binary or another non-sensical gender. 

It?s are a real life game of domination and submission where they are the Dominant ones and ?Cis? women are the Subs. 

There are FOUR lights, dammit! It is literal mental torture to have to comply with pronoun and perception demands of the trans community. The more I learn about it, the more staunchly I become against it.

An Ohio Republican has proposed legislation to change state child exploitation law, in response to a nine-year-old boy?s drag performance at a local bar which sparked an online furor after video was published by a fringe conservative website.

The video shows the boy, who performs as Miss Mae Hem, in a pink leotard doing cartwheels, splits and a classic drag move called a death drop, which involves falling down.

The state representative Tim Schaffer?s bill would expand the definition of child endangering to stop businesses with liquor licenses holding performances in which a ?child simulates sexual activity?.

Schaffer said in a statement he was introducing the bill because of a video featuring Miss Mae Hem, which he said showed the child performing a ?provocative sexually explicit dance routine?.

In the video, which runs about four minutes, Miss Mae Hem performs dance moves common to children?s dance classes as well as vogueing, a traditional drag dance style that is not inherently sexual. The performer also collects money from a cheering audience.

Miss Mae Hem, whose real name is Jacob Measley, had been performing in and around Toledo for more than a year before sparking the ire of local politicians.

The furor seems to have started with a Facebook post that claimed to be by the city of Lancaster, where the performance took place, but was actually made by an imposter account.

Mayor David Scheffler said the Facebook page that complained about the performance was ?in no way affiliated with the City of Lancaster?.

?There have been serious threats of violence resulting from this post,? Scheffler said. ?Let us hope and pray that no harm comes to person or property as a result of it.?

A video was also shared by Christian Journal Media, a conservative website whose editor-in-chief, Rich Penkoski, frequently campaigns against drag queens. Penkoski is a minister for the fringe Warriors for Christ ministry, which denounces most Christians and Catholics.

In an interview with the Toledo Blade, Jacob Measley?s mother, Jerri Measley, said her family?s intentions have been ?grossly warped?. City police investigated complaints about the video but found no violation of state law or city ordinance. Measley said child protective services visited her home.

?Jacob is just a guy who likes to dress up and dance and feel pretty,? she said. ?It?s kind of like Halloween every time he has the opportunity to do it.?

She said she understood why some people might object to her son performing in a bar, but said they were among the only venues where people could explore drag culture.

?Where else is there right now for children who identify as being in the LGBT community to explore that interest?? Measley asked.

A Democratic lawmaker in Ohio, Teresa Fedor, told the Toledo Blade she supported Schaffer?s bill and said: ?When we?re trying to prevent human trafficking from happening, especially the commercial, sexual exploitation of children, I don?t see how this is not very closely related to that issue ? that concept of a rape culture where we?re normalizing this type of activity.?

It is becoming more common for children to show an interest in drag culture, in part because of the wild success of the reality TV show RuPaul?s Drag Race. It is in its 11th season. Its 10th season, in 2018, had a record overall viewership of 723,000.",0,1555852851.0,bfoq8w,79,GenderCritical
2701,"I went to college from 2006-2011, and in that time I saw a huge shift in the kinda queer feminist spaces that I hung out in.  In my early years of college, I was friends with a variety of women who wore different clothes, and we were activists for things like abortion rights, fighting the patriarchy, rape on campus, FGM.  There was one FTM trans person, who bound his breasts and preferred male pronouns, and I never really thought anything about it.  

Around 2010, things really changed. Everything became about ""Hi, I'm \_\_\_ and my preferred pronouns are they, xi, them.""  Ooook.  If we tried to talk about women's issues such as abortion or FGM, it ""wasn't inclusive for women without vaginas.""  The biggest activism became getting hormonal therapy to trans people in prison.  

I'm going to try to lay out my main concerns:

1. There is a finite amount of time and space for discussion and activism, and I feel now that the amount of time dealing with trans issues is not proportional to the amount of people affected.  I do think that dysphoric people face some major issues, but on a global scale, there are just so many more women who are facing problems that come from having a vagina.
2. I do not understand ""feeling like a woman,"" because I have never once felt that way.  The only thing that makes me feel like a woman is the fact that I have a vagina and the gender roles that have been taught to me because of that.  I see sex and I see gender roles, but wtf actually is ""gender"" as this intrinsic state of being woman? 
3. There's like this oppression Olympics kinda thing going around in the spaces where I used to feel most comfortable, and I feel like just identifying as trans in some way now is used to grant people a power to speak over others.  I don't feel comfortable voicing my concerns or opinions anymore, and have gotten ""called out"" (as they say) for saying something transphobic (again, I think this was when I said abortion is a women's rights issue). 
4. I don't understand why a lot of trans people say things like ""I am a woman because I just AM a woman"" and wear feminine clothes, but then a second later say things like, ""As a trans person, I think...""  It seems more like identifying as being a transwoman than a woman, but idk.
5. I don't really care about using preferred pronouns if they make someone feel more comfy living in a gendered world, although ""they"" is just like argh.  My main issues are with the systemic underlying premises and effects, not with problems on a person-to-person basis.",0,1555851913.0,bfolk2,47,GenderCritical

Freddy exclaims that while she was making the documentary 'anti trans rhetoric' and 'transphobia' was on the rise with regard to the proposed legislative reform to the gender recognition act. The Guardian, astonishingly, says there is 'little evidence of any risk' of moving males to female prisons, and that safeguarding procedures are put in place to keep women safe. This is nonsense - Karen White, a TIM, sexually assaulted two women in a mother and baby unit, and prison experts warned the government that manipulative trans prisoners were trying to game the system to get access to women only spaces.

&#x200B;

The Guardian also bizarrely claims that anti trans rhetoric comes from the alt right, and 'some feminists' who argue that biology is destiny. This is a complete misrepresentation of the gender critical position: gender critical feminists do NOT think that biology is destiny. The Guardian managed to report the precise opposite of what gender critical feminists actually believe. But I do have to say, I find this whining about 'biology is destiny' particularly ironic in an article about a 'man' giving birth. It's also ironic how Freddy gushes that giving birth is the 'peak human experience'.

Last month, [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/joannachiu/status/1110079640998023168?s=12) detailing a woman?s observation of a man who appeared to be in his late 30s sexually harassing a teenage girl during a flight went viral. Joanna Chiu, a Canadian journalist who was sitting in the row in front of them, had planned to get some sleep during an overnight flight, but ?couldn?t avoid noticing what was going on in the row behind me.?

The man started by asking the teenage girl about what career she?d like to pursue, laughing when the girl replied she hoped to be a CEO, Chiu tweeted. The man soon became very familiar, Chiu recounted, teasing the girl and asking to take her out to eat, which the girl ignored. ?At this point I had to stay awake in case anything went further than that,? Chiu tweeted.

Chiu monitored the conversation, and ultimately intervened when the man asked the young girl for a ?dirty? photo. A woman seated in the row behind the girl had also been monitoring the situation and offered the girl support. The women got the attention of the flight crew, and with much resistance from the man, they eventually managed to force him to move seats.

?But none of the male passengers seemed to show they noticed what was going on. Maybe fellow women are more likely to pick up on warning signs early on in the conversation because we used to be teenage girls too?? Chiu tweeted, going on to recount her own experiences as a young girl travelling alone and the male passengers who had spoken to her inappropriately and forced a kiss on her without her consent.

From online discussions like these and others, mainstream society is slowly awakening to the fact that a majority of women move through the world in a constant, heightened state of awareness.

Sadia Saeed, a psychologist and founder of Inner Space Counseling in Mumbai, recounts the ways she has heard women talk about staying vigilant about their surroundings ? paying attention to ?whether we?re being watched or not, is it a dark space, what we?re wearing.?

**Related on The Swaddle:**

[**#MeToo Is Making People Confront Their Trauma. And Most Are Unequipped To Do So.**](https://theswaddle.com/metoo-india-mental-health-and-trauma/)

But Saeed hesitates to qualify this state as hypervigilance, a clinical term that describes a state of increased sensory alertness. Hypervigilance, Saeed says, is ?the body saying there is a threat in the environment, so, you have to be at your most alert self. You can?t be relaxed, because if you?re quiet or relaxed, then something bad can happen to you. The system is always sensing threat.? In fact, a hypervigilant person might perceive stressors as threatening when others simply view them as stressors. Hypervigilance is considered a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder and has been documented in soldiers and natural disaster victims. It is also associated with anxiety and other mood or personality disorders.

In women, ?conditioning already leads to vigilance,? she says. ?If you add an incident that leaves a traumatic impact? then hypervigilance is probable, though not inevitable. ?Different people process \[trauma\] differently,? she says, adding that a lack of coping mechanisms contributes to the development of hypervigilance after a traumatic experience. (She also notes hypervigilance isn?t always the effect of gendered trauma, and it can also affect men.)

?Trauma can take many forms,? she says. ?It can manifest in many forms, too.?

One of those forms could be vicarious, she says, that is, an emotional reaction to others? accounts of trauma that leaves a person anxious, angry and/or sad; in the midst of [India?s wave of #MeToo](https://theswaddle.com/tag/metoo/)reporting late last year, [many of those involved in the movement reported exhaustion, depression, distress,](https://theswaddle.com/metoo-india-mental-health-and-trauma/) panic attacks, hyper-stimulation and more, not necessarily from their own trauma (though in many cases, that, too) but from empathetic reactions to an onslaught of stories about abuse, harassment and rape.

These stories surround us; newspapers report brutal crimes against women almost every day. Even fiction provides no escape. In a [recent op-ed for The Guardian, Hallie Rubenhold spotlights](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/02/from-jack-the-ripper-to-ted-bundy-why-are-dead-womens-bodies-still-being-used-as-entertainment) ?our drive to use women?s brutalized bodies as a flimsy springboard to tell a story about a male killer.? She lists an overwhelming number of popular and upcoming shows that rely on abused, maimed and murdered women to frame the narrative ? Netflix?s *Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes*; Hollywood?s upcoming E*xtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile*, also about the serial killer; BBC One?s *Jack the Ripper ? The Case Reopened*. Prestige television is awash with it, she argues: *Luther*. *True Detective*. *The Killing*. *The Fall*. *Top of the Lake*. It would be remiss not to add to that list India?s latest prestige drama, [*Delhi Crime*](https://theswaddle.com/delhi-crime-tackles-rape-but-not-rape-culture/), based on the gruesome and barbaric rape and murder of 2012?s Nirbhaya case.

Even for women removed from these (largely) digital movements and entertainment, vicarious trauma is possible; according to the last National Family Health Survey (NHFS-4), [one in every three women in India experiences sexual or physical abuse at home](https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-elephant-in-the-room-every-third-woman-in-india-faces-domestic-violence-1654193.html), making it likely that most women know the true-life story of at least one woman who is the survivor of assault, if not more.

There are no reliable stats on hypervigilance in women, though it is well-known that anxiety disorders, which often accompany hypervigilance, [are twice as common in women than men](https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/women/facts). There are only stories like Chiu?s, which anecdotally every woman can identify with, but no one has quantified. Without figures, however, it?s difficult to gauge the fallout. Hypervigilance, as an ongoing state of fight-or-flight, takes a physical toll. ?There will be a lot of physiological reactions similar to chronic stress,? says Saeed. Digestion, sleep and endocrine function will be disrupted, she says. Chronic stress has also been linked to [increased risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attack, and impaired fertility and sexual desire](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-body).

While the increased awareness of environmental threats most women describe may not always qualify clinically as hypervigilance, it?s difficult to rule out the possibility that this heightened alertness has similar effects. ?It?s a spectrum,? Saeed says. ?There?s no point at which you can say, ?This is relaxed, and this is hyperawareness.'?

?We have mental stories about what is likely to happen to us. And we?re not aware of these stories, and we?re not aware of our bodily reactions \[to them\],? she says. Dealing with heightened alertness means becoming more aware of what your body is going through. ?The bodily system has been wired to be alert; you can?t force it to shut down.

You have to rewire it to relax,? she says. Saeed advises in the moment of heightened response (not in moments of actual danger) grounding your feet and focusing on your breath. Over time, meditating can help if the feelings of increased awareness become overwhelming ? until, of course, society stops giving women a reason to be hyper alert.

?A certain degree of increased vigilance comes with \[gendered\] conditioning,? Saeed says. ?Conditioning has a big role to play in it.?

I used to think it's better to be a good girl. Be modest and save everything about yourself for the one. Besides, men hate attention whores, don't they? In light of how men treat us independently of our choices though, I'm starting to have a big change of heart. I applaud the women that don't have a need for romantic relationships or affection, but if you're not like that, I think it's way wiser to get your ""hit"" from a multitude of men that you aren't committing to at all, rather than entering a relationship with a man that could always lie and change.

After thinking long and hard about everything I stand for and also reviewing some of the awful experiences I've had on sets. I was shooting a music video for my last job ever and I wasn't told who the artist would be. 

Turns out it was an insanely mysgonistic rapper and I would be dancing in the background.  Everyone was professional on set and besides the fact I worked hours that were way too long and wasn't paid (it was a ""trial""), however once off set things got ugly. I'm engaged and the rapper knew this but kept texting me and contacting me on instagram demanding we have a date night, asking when he can call me when I'm alone etc. After I politely declined and told him again I'm engaged he cut all my scenes in the video. I'd stayed later than any girl because he wanted me in main scenes with him and yet they have all been cut from the video. I never showed interest in this guy at all, no signs whatsoever yet because I declined sleeping with him he tries to sabotage my career.

Along with this the only shots they did use of me were super objectifying (a close up of under my boobs).

My first ever modeling shoot actually turned out to be a guy who was involved in a sex trafficking ring- he offered me drugs and alcohol and had a whole room set up to groom young vulnerable girls. I've had photograohers try to take me to hotels, try to push my limits and shoot me nude, and I've generally just felt unsafe and scared more times than I can count. 

My experiences aren't rare either - Cameron Russel had a campaign on instagram about models being sexually harrassed at work. Tons of young girls sent her their stories (I encourage you to check it out!). Plus the amount of times you'll be asked to work for free is ridiculous - and girls will do it because it's such a sought after job.

This is long, so bear with me. 


For a bit of background, an MSU student, Erik Powell was enrolled in a human sexuality class. He met with his professor to discuss his discomfort with a TiM in the class- Myka Perry- and requested that he not sit next to Perry, or interact with him. When the professor asked what Powell would do if Perry attempted to engage with him, Powell said that he would tell Perry to stop, and if he persisted Powell would ?break her face?. He allegedly made references to keeping loaded guns in his truck. The professor notified campus police of this threat, and Powell was suspended from campus, pending investigation. 


At this point the situation became a Title IX investigation. [The Title IX coordinator](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/msu-title-ix-director-steps-down-lawsuit-alleges-bias-against/article_84952c53-fada-543f-9301-28511c535b59.html), a woman who identified herself on social media as ?an aspiring ally? to LGBT people, sent a gushing email to the TiM student, thanking him for ?trusting? the Title IX office. She offered Perry assistance and guidance beyond the scope of the investigation. She also failed to report that Perry stated that he carries a knife with him on campus - which he showed her.

Powell was found guilty, and his case became a cause celebre among MRAs and the right wing and anyone else decrying discrimination against straight men on college campuses. 


Powell appealed, and a judge agreed with him. He recently won a settlement, and his expulsion was stricken from his record. He is attending another college. The Title IX coordinator, and at least one other faculty member involved in the case were reassigned. Now Perry is suing the university- not because of this case, but because the university health insurance is not covering his facial feminization surgery, or his Adam?s Apple reduction :/

One got a $120,000 reward for expressing his toxic masculinity, the other is potentially getting thousands of dollars worth of cosmetic surgery on someone else?s dime.

Hello! 

I have been lurking on this subreddit for many months now, and finally decided to create a Reddit account and subscribe. I feel I have so much to say, most of which I cannot express in either Ex Muslim or liberal feminist places (and certainly not in my 'own' community i.e the South Asian/Muslim community). But this community seems like it is full of women who may actually *get* it, and finding radical feminism has been a revelation for me - so here goes. I hope this is the appropriate place to share some of my experiences, please let me know if it is not!  

**Part One: Being raised a girl in a patriarchal Muslim family (hint: nobody checked my 'gender identity' before deciding my place, worth or rights in life).**


I was raised in a traditional Sunni Muslim household.  Growing up as a girl and then a woman in this religion suffocated me every day. Whatever many Muslims and the so-called liberal left would like to say, my community were not 'extreme' in the sense that their interpretation of Islam was not some crazy, evil, radical interpretation, nor were they random evil people influenced only by their 'culture' as distinct from their religious beliefs. No, our family life was an entirely normal, traditional interpretation of Islam based on standard understandings of the main scriptures and teachings (Quran, Hadith & commentary). 

I went to mosque five times a week, where I was taught that my body should be covered to a much higher degree than my male siblings; that my inheritance and testimony was worth half that of a male's even though I shouldered the financial burden at home (being the only one with a decent job); that if I refused my husband sex, the angels would curse me all night; that my husband could marry four wives PLUS what was then taught to me as 'that which his right hand possesses', but what I now, frankly, call 'concubines' or 'sex slaves'; that my husband could 'beat' me if I disobeyed him, but that was OK because according to some scholars he could 'only' do it with a 'light tap' or that he could 'only' do it as a last resort after he had first tried to separate our beds, then not speaking to me, as though I was a child to be admonished into obedience - and on and on it goes. Please note that my intention is not to start any religious debates about the exact literal meaning of these verses, etc, but just to try to explain how demeaned I felt growing up as a young woman in Islam. 

I felt suffocated not only by the clothes I had been commanded by God to wear (as I believed at the time), but also by the entire ideology itself and what that said about my place in the world. 'Hijab' is not just a piece of fabric around one's hair - it separates you from your fellow males and teaches you that something about YOUR hair and body as opposed to theirs is inherently lustful, sinful, to be viewed only by the man you end up marrying (and some other close family members); it mandates that you do not show the shape of your body; it dictates that when you walk, you wear no 'noisy' jewellery or perfume so as not to attract male attention - it is just one part of an entire system of modesty which disproportionately burdens women. 

I tried so hard to really believe all of this was 'empowering' in some way, that it meant I had escaped the beauty standards and objectification of women in society - but how could I ever really believe that, when hijab is sexualised just as much as anything else by many men. I have been proposed to and hit on in the lewdest ways by men whilst dressed head to toe in black, with my hair covered. I never deep down believed this was an empowering system, I could never really grasp it. I tried to read the Quran to educate myself and find justification for what seemed like inherent unfairness to women, but everything I read just made me more and more disgusted. 

No wonder, then,  that I despised being a woman. I hated it. I did not want this life, I remember telling my father from a young age that I wish I had been born a boy, that I wanted *their* modesty obligations (basically just cover from the navel to the knees) and just enjoy basic freedoms like playing outside in the sunshine without worrying about exposing my elbows or a strand of hair (sidenote, when everything is covered, men will fetishize literally anything - elbows, strands of hair, a quick flash of ankle, that is all it takes. Hijab never made me feel protected). But I could not 'identify' my way out of my place in life. Nobody asked me what my gender identity was before they decided my rights in marriage, my inheritance rights, the modesty doctrine I was to follow. My entire self worth was decided the moment that I was born and my parents saw I had a vagina, rather than a penis. This was to dictate the rest of my life, and become even more of a burden once puberty hit and my breasts developed and I suddenly became a walking sin to be covered up.  This is why the idea that a man can just 'identify' into womanhood and then demand I do not 'centre' my feminism around my vagina/genitals/reproductive system is so offensive to me. My vagina and female body has been the reason for my oppression and second class status my whole life, I can no sooner de-centre it from my life than I can turn into a unicorn. 

**Part Two: Becoming an Ex Muslim and finding liberal feminism**

To cut a long story short, after years of struggling with my faith I eventually ended up leaving Islam and becoming an atheist. I could not tolerate it anymore. I did not want to get married to a man and sign up to a religious marriage which I felt was a deeply demeaning institution for women. 

After many years, I found some other ex Muslim women (and men) in a local community. But I felt out of step with many of them too, as the feminism in these communities (in my experience) tends to be a very liberal 'sex positive' kind of feminism - in a panel on feminism and Islam, one of the women called herself a sex positive feminist when asked about the sex trade. I was uncomfortable with this, but never found the language to express why I could not get on board if porn/prostitution was 'personal choice.' It felt strange to me that as Ex Muslim women, we were able to see the inherent problems with claiming the hijab is a free, empowering, feminist choice. Many Ex Muslim women spoke of how this sort of 'choice' feminist defence of the hijab was only really relevant for relatively few privileged Western women, whilst many of our sisters across the globe were forced into it. They acknowledged that even amongst ourselves in our very liberal world, we had often tried to convince ourselves we felt 'empowered' by or 'chose' the hijab when oftentimes the very idea that it was 'commanded by God' or expected by the community created a lot of pressure to wear it to be seen as 'pure' or 'worthy'. And yet these same women did not seem to apply the same kind of critique of 'choice' feminism to things like the sex trade, prostitution, etc. I would be curious to know if any other Ex Muslim/ex religious women felt like this? 

Also, in the Ex Muslim groups I saw very young, vulnerable women who had just been kicked out of their homes in polyamorous relationships with older men. Again, this made me uncomfortable - these men were also the same people helping  to support the woman in question financially and the women never seemed as happy about the polyamory as the men did. Maybe this is just my perception, but I have personally spoken to at least a few of the women who confessed they really wanted an exclusive relationship with the man in question. Also many women expressed feeling 'preyed upon' in private by some of the ex Muslim men who joined just to find women to sleep with. There was also a lot of pressure to sleep around and I was not into any of that. I got the feeling that having left a very restrictive religion, Ex Muslim men and women placed a very high value on personal freedom and choice, especially when it came to sexual partners, perhaps for entirely understandable reasons. But it did result in a sort of converse pressure to sleep around, be cool and free - I wanted to reject Islam but not then be pressured to sleep around to prove how free and liberal I was. 

Why does this matter? Because when I first moved out of my family's home many years ago, I was alone and had no family. I was lost, confused, penniless. After some months of this, I met a much older man and ended up for a while sleeping on his sofa - until he wanted more. I had my first sexual experiences with this man.  When the person you are sleeping with is the only thing keeping a roof over your head, choice became difficult, blurry. Luckily I realised very quickly that I was very, very uncomfortable and found the resources to do something about it, but not before I experienced sexual assault at a very vulnerable stage in my life. Nobody in the world should be pressured or forced - whether by force or financial circumstance to sell use of their bodies/sex. I still struggle to understand why my experience of Ex Muslim communities is that they do not often acknowledge this, and treat these decisions as empowering/liberal choices. 

I also struggle to understand why many are so quick to dismiss women who want female only spaces and have legitimate concerns about men in our spaces, particularly in rape centres, changing rooms etc. Given that so many of us were oppressed by men because of our female bodies, I would have expected more support. It has been heart breaking to find the opposite.  

**Part Three: Finding radical feminism and this sub**

I had been mulling over the above issues for many years, slowly feeling like I was going crazy. I was so incredibly glad when I found this sub reddit! Thank you all so much, I have never commented before but really found a lot of strength with the unapologetic women-centred support I see in this subreddit. When people call this place hateful, I wonder if they ever think of all the people you lift up and strengthen. I know many Ex Muslim women feel betrayed by liberal feminism, but so far radical feminists have unapologetically refused to sell us out for fear of criticising Islam. 

It was a great older teacher and mentor of mine who introduced me to radical feminism. She is an amazing retired lesbian rad fem who has really supported me over the years. She challenged my thinking when I was Muslim and never stopped criticising the hijab, religious marriage, etc. I owe so much of my life and freedom to her - so I would like to say to all you older radfem women, we younger women need you. Thank you to each and every one of you!

My high school did nothing about a boy who photoshopped a girl?s face onto photos of Hitler which he then shared all over social media (only deleted them to avoid trouble because she was brave and reported him to school authorities) because he didn?t like the fact that she was a feminist. They gave him and his buddies (who were also in on it) a stern talking to and that was it. Afterwards, the manbabies wouldn?t stop complaining about how they almost got expelled (AS IF..) and lambasted her for being ?so sensitive it was a joke jeeez wimmin!1!!? This guy was my friend at the time so when I asked the friend group why they thought her reporting him for such aggressions behaviour is wrong, they were outraged and claimed she could?ve ?ruined his life and education? the way society talks about men on trial for rape which is ridiculous. She was only rightfully indicting him for his own behaviour and he didn?t even face any consequences..

2. A piece of shit in Grade 10 flashed a Grade 7 girl on the schoolbus. He was suspended for like 3 days or a week (forgot) and nothing else happened.

For several years my boyfriend was emotionally abusive. He never hit me, but he used his anger and threats of violence to keep me in line. He tried to control what I did for a living, what I wore, and even what time I came home. He didn't want me to drive, and his criticisms of my driving almost got us into more than one car accident (but not as many near-accidents as his own driving. He tended to drive recklessly, especially when angry). He treated me like a child and had complete control of our finances, he chided me in public and shamed me for minor things in front of strangers, and when I tried to stand up for myself, he acted just like a TRA and whimpered and whined, telling me how much I'd hurt him. 

His abuse also crossed the line into sexual abuse, also like a TRA. He'd spend the day either criticizing me or neglecting/ignoring me, only to turn around and expect sex. He would pester and pester and pester, often wearing me down. Afterward I would always feel nauseated and dirty, but also somehow guilty for not wanting to in the first place. 

I put up with this for a long, long time, and the last straw was when he started having an affair. He flaunted it in my face, and to be honest, I came close to ending it all several times before I finally let her have him, packed my bags, and left town. For all I know they're still together, but for her sake I hope not. 

I've been away from him for several years now, but I don't feel like I've healed because I haven't really processed the abuse. I've told hardly anyone about the abuse. Not our mutual friends from my former community, not (many of) my new friends, and not my family. Part of this is because I'm sure that, as a woman, either nobody will believe me, or everyone will think it was my fault, especially the cheating. Because obviously, so much sarcasm, it's not that he was a predator, it's that I worked too much or gained too much weight or had too many thoughts or something of the sort. 

Another part of it, a part I'm ashamed of, is that I'm protecting the little bastard. Part of this is female socialization, but part of it is that he ""rescued"" me from a situation that was even worse, and where there was actual physical abuse. I can't stop thinking that I would never have been strong enough to get away from the previous bastard on my own, so I feel like I owe him. It's sick and it's awful and I wish I could get that thought out of my head, but the idea of myself as a sad, useless, pathetic little damsel is etched into my brain, even as I continue to evolve and become more independent. 

That's the venting part, and how here's the question part. How the hell do I stop being grateful to him and start being angry? How do I move past female socialization and stop blaming myself for not being good enough, pretty enough, skinny enough, stupid enough, sexually receptive enough (the other woman was conventionally pretty and docile)? Are there any books or articles out there on emotional abuse that are written by radical feminists, and unlikely to contain victim-blaming and tripe about forgiving? I'm also a firm believer in therapy, but I'm reluctant because I know so many women who've suffered through libfem therapists. I don't want to be set back even more because some horse's ass wants me to look for my ""part"" in the situation or treats me as ""codependent,"" which is a term relating to drug and alcohol addiction and not relationships... but somehow, nobody seems to understand this? 

Radical feminist perspectives on abuse desperately needed, especially if anyone has a mental health background or has been through something similar. Thanks, sisters, for giving me a place to talk about this. You're some of the first people I've come out to.

Recently, I've been seeing increased posts about the uptake of toxic and misguidedly 'feminist' ideas being used to target and harm trans people. I've also seen trans folks in this sub and others internalize and/or identify with some of these beliefs.

As somebody who self-harmed by visiting subs dedicated to manufacturing and spreading this rhetoric, I just want to ask all of my trans siblings to go easy on yourselves, to know that you are loved by your trans family, and to know that your trans identity is not something to be ashamed of. I'm writing this message from a throwaway account, because in the past, I was targeted by these so called 'feminists' with doxxing and other threats for writing these kinds of messages. I just don't want to deal with that anymore, but I do think this message needs to be repeated every so often.

Here are some important ideas that I hope you will remember and reflect on to overcome internalized transphobia and other forms of self-loathing:

* Gender dysphoria is a real issue. For those who struggle with this very human and real condition, you didn't 'choose' to experience gender dysphoria. You are doing the best that you can to overcome something that you do not have control over. There is a huge body of evidence to suggest that attempting to 'repair' or 'transform' feelings of gender dysphoria (and gender identity) through talk therapy are ineffective and deleterious, so I'm not going to cite everything that comes to mind. But here's a very accessible synthesis of some of this literature: [https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/355235](https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/355235)
* You were not 100% socialized as your assigned sex. If any of you who hold this belief, please think about this carefully. Socialization includes both the normative conditioning that is imposed on you based on your assigned sex, **AND** your internalization/response to this conditioning (some of it conscious, some of it not). As a trans woman who was closeted and dysphoric since my very early memories, I can definitely say that although I was expected to perform masculinity in certain ways, and probably did reap some 'gendered' benefits from my upbringing, I was in so much distress through my childhood that I did not reap the same benefits as, for instance, my cis brother. I'm sure many of you have similar stories. I'm not saying we should ignore our pre-transition histories, especially if we're open to talking about them, but we do not have the same exact 'filters' that we apply to messages we receive in our socialization as cis folks of our assigned sex. Please read the Whipping Girl by Julia Serano and play close attention to her account of socialization. For AFAB folks, check out Leslie Feinberg's work - they are an exceptional and amazing writer. I'm sure you'll see at least small parts of your story reflected in these texts.
* There is no such as a universal ""AFAB socialization experience"" and a universal ""AMAB socialization experience."" Assigned sex is just one dimension of bio/social location that helps explain how our childhood comes together to affect our adult experiences. Factors like race, class, our performance of gender non-conformity (including perceived non-heterosexuality), mental health, along with (dis)ability, all come together to determine how we experience socialization and how that socialization impacts our adult lives. The socialization of a South Asian trans woman, who was raised for much of her childhood in a very LGBTQ-hostile country while actively dysphoric and attracted to men, reflects disadvantage in a way that is totally absent from from the experience of a cis straight white woman who is raised in North America. The socialization of a poor cis gay black man in the US reflects disadvantage in ways that are very distinct and important to recognize, relative to the upbringing of a straight cis white woman in the US whose family is upper middle class. I apologize if this is overly simplistic to people who are familiar with intersectionality, but bear in mind that there people who are not and need to be reminded of this.
* Transphobes who hide behind 'feminism' like to misuse the infamous Swedish study to indicate that trans women have 'male-pattern criminality,' and that this somehow is 'proof' that we are really just men. They ignore that FTM men in that sample also reported 'male-pattern criminality,' and that 'male-pattern criminality' is just a bogus concept when we realize that many marginalized groups of people engage in violent crime at rates that are higher than those reported in 'genpop' samples of women. There is plenty of literature to suggest that lesbian and gay couples, for example, report higher rates of domestic violence than heterosexual couples (even when we disaggregate by sex and gender) and young lesbian women have rates of 'criminality' that far exceed those of same-age straight women. See, for example: ([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kateryna\_Sylaska/publication/275220195\_Intimate\_Partner\_Violence\_Among\_Sexual\_Minority\_Populations\_A\_Critical\_Review\_of\_the\_Literature\_and\_Agenda\_for\_Future\_Research/links/558dba8b08ae47a3490bd5e8.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kateryna_Sylaska/publication/275220195_Intimate_Partner_Violence_Among_Sexual_Minority_Populations_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Literature_and_Agenda_for_Future_Research/links/558dba8b08ae47a3490bd5e8.pdf)) and ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10467488](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10467488)). This is not because lesbians and gay men are all somehow 'socialized as violent males' - it is because there are unique circumstances that underly those numbers, including factors like minority stress (i.e., homophobia), poverty, mental health issues, substance use, etc - issues that are common across marginalized groups. The lower crime rates of 'Genpop women' have been explained by theories of socialization that apply specifically to cis straight white women in North America and Europe. A great reading on this topic is ""The LGBT Offender"" in this book: [https://books.scholarsportal.info/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks3/springer/2014-04-01/1/9781461491880](https://books.scholarsportal.info/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks3/springer/2014-04-01/1/9781461491880) , which also summarizes some of the statistical differences in criminality between heterosexual and sexual minority women.
* Yes, cis women do sometimes harm trans people (including trans women) with physical and sexual violence. In fact, in data collected by FORGE in 2004, 30% of trans respondents reported being sexually assaulted at least once by a female perpetrator (the researchers include a separate category for ""transgender perpetrators,"" before people start wondering if that just means MTF on MTF violence): [http://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/partners-guide.pdf](http://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/partners-guide.pdf)
* I, as a trans woman, am not personally responsible for the violent behaviours of some trans people, in the same that I am not personally responsible for the violent behaviours of some people who are my race (hint: I'm not a white person, and my race is frequently targeted with suspicions of being inherently violent). If a trans person did a terrible thing, I'm sorry this happened and I will always condemn the act. However, I will not take it a step further to claim that that act represents who trans people are as a whole. I will also continue standing in solidarity with other trans people (who are still much more likely to experience violence than perpetrate it, and are still underrecognized as a category of victimized people). If you don't engage in violence, I hope we get to stand together in this way.
* Trans people are not responsible for the erosion of women's services. The patriarchy, and sexism/misogyny as systems driven by this structure, are responsible for eroding women's services. If there is violence in the context of women's spaces, it's often because said women's space is poorly resourced and underfunded (yes, this includes spaces intended for trans women specifically, not just ones that exclude trans women), and therefore lacks the capacity to provide the range of services needed to help women recover following exposure to trauma. Violence has historically occurred in women's spaces back when they were exclusively intended for AFAB people, and it continues in trans-inclusive women's spaces now, likely for the same reasons. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of literature on women's experiences in women's spaces because, well, women's issues tended to be ignored in research. Here is a qualitative study from 1999 though, indicating that this has and unfortunately will remain a possibility by virtue of the system I'm describing here: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leslie\_Tutty/publication/229085616\_Residents%27\_Views\_of\_the\_Efficacy\_of\_Shelter\_Services\_for\_Assaulted\_Women/links/00b7d52000da702647000000/Residents-Views-of-the-Efficacy-of-Shelter-Services-for-Assaulted-Women.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leslie_Tutty/publication/229085616_Residents%27_Views_of_the_Efficacy_of_Shelter_Services_for_Assaulted_Women/links/00b7d52000da702647000000/Residents-Views-of-the-Efficacy-of-Shelter-Services-for-Assaulted-Women.pdf).

2783,"After reading another thread, I have a few thoughts about passing for trans people, both male and female, but more male.

Jenn Smith in one of his videos said that the TRA movement courted the media through what he called ""cooing doves."" Beautiful, socially charming, well put together TIMs would go on Phil Donahue and be perfectly lovely. Looking at old talk shows from the late 70s and early 80s, I see what he means. The TIMs did, on television, ""pass."" But there were some particular reasons for it that I don't think the average ""cooing dove"" could achieve today.

First, television was only in standard def. On the average small screen this would cover a lot. No one had ever heard of transition via hormones and surgery before, so I could see how people might think that an HSTS was a rather odd looking but still beautiful woman. I'm guessing there was more gate keeping back then and doctors were more honest about not taking on cases where they knew damn well they couldn't make a near passing patient.

When it was just a few trans people visible, they probably did pass, but when there were more and more TIMs, HSTS or not, the patterns became more apparent. The center of gravity. Buttocks that were just a little oddly shaped. Chins that were just a little too strong. Shoulders that no diet could wear away.

Once the selfie became a thing, the cat was out of the bag. Now everyone knew how makeup, lighting, filters and photo shop worked. It went from being a slightly unusual looking woman to a garden variety appearance that would only pass in highly controlled and brief circumstances. The HSTS men pass less than they did 40 odd years ago. So the whole ""How do you even know a woman is trans?!"" is based off of a bygone era when almost no one knew about transsexuality.

Now that transgenderism is well known in Western societies, ""stealth"" is getting harder and ""clocking"" is unavoidable. 

I am 38 and am frequently mistaken for about 20, but plenty of things would give me away if I sat down at a table with 20 year old women. Even the overweight ones. Even the tan addict ones who already have wrinkles. Even the one with the dancer's bunions. If I can't fully pass as an age I actually did experience, you can never pass as what you never were. A 70 year old man watching the whole table would figure out that I am most likely his daughter's age, not his granddaughter's. People might be sort of fooled because most have never encountered a 38 year old woman trying to convince everyone she's trans generational. They'd still see that something is wrong, even if they can't name it. But if trans generational became a thing, it would be obvious every time.

That's why I think plastic surgeons should tell TIMs that stealth should never be the goal, since it will not be met. I think they should tell TIFs, that, too, since patterns are emerging in that movement as well.

I remember studying Concept Theory in my cognitive sciences courses in college and it was fascinating.  There are a lot of theories on how humans categorize certain concepts.  Cognitive scientists discuss at length how humans know a table is a table? what is its ?tableness? that distinguishes it from, let?s say, a chair.  Some argue prototype theory; some argue exemplar theory; some argue that your brain has nodes that light up when you see a table and different amounts of nodes lighting up mean different levels of tableyness.  But they all agree that humans have the ability recognize and categorize tables as tables and chairs as chairs, and that both tables and chairs exist.  Somewhat like ?obscenity?, you know it when you see it, and the questions the cognitive scientists are trying to answer is ?why? and ?how.?

But it?s been a long time since I studied this and I definitely don?t have a strong enough background to make a true cogent argument.  But the gist would be:
while people may have different theories as to how to define what a woman is, how and if to measure or quantify ?womanhood? or ?womanliness?, that does not mean that the concept of a ?woman? doesn?t actually exist as a cohesive theory.

They've published a lot of horrific garbage over the years, and I'm happy to know that their readership is too abysmal to keep it going.

Nothing could make it more clear that Queer/PoMo advocates are diametrically opposed to the aims of feminism. Feminism is a movement centered upon female liberation, with the understanding that male violence is a global endemic. Males are responsible for: 99% of rapes, 96% of homicides, 83% of arson, 78% of violent assault. The only reason we know those numbers is because sex is acknowledged at birth. **By advocating for the end of recording sex, they are advocating for any method by which we can know, understand, and respond to male violence/female subjugation.**

But that's just the tip of the iceberg on the implications of this. Millions of females are missing from the global population due to sex selective infanticide and abortion. Women receive substandard healthcare because most medical studies are conducted on the male body. If the genderists/MRA dream comes to pass, **every sex-based statistic we know would be gone within a single generation.**

There are plenty of articles full of propaganda and false claims worthy of ridicule. [This article](https://theestablishment.co/no-female-trans-athletes-do-not-have-unfair-advantages-14b8e249f93c/) goes against established (pun intended) medical science to assert that trans women (males) have absolutely no physical advantage over women.

Everyone is welcome to have opinions on what the rules ought to be and how they ought to be enforced.

However, rules are only rules if they're enforced. The mods do the enforcing, so individuals here (or groups while we're at it) do not get to decide without the mods what the rules (or guidelines) are going to be. 

Do not post rules or guidelines. The only rules in this community are written down in our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/wiki/rules). Rules specific to certain threads may be posted by mods in individual threads. Everything else is a matter of opinions and is not an actual rule.

When women break the rules here, we do not go and publicize the details of what they have done wrong. We remove comments that break the rules, which means most people cannot see rule-breaking posts that people have made, in threads or in comment histories. We give women temp bans if we think they aren't just trolls, because we have faith in women and want women to be able to post here. We hate banning women and we take it seriously. However, this community wouldn't be what it is without standards and rules that are enforced. In particular, this community wouldn't work if we allowed women to attack other women. If you want to attack certain kinds of women or groups of women, this isn't the place to do it. 

Sometimes women who have been banned decide to complain about being banned here. For instance, saying we're biased, bigoted, oppressors, or we aren't real radical feminists. This is pretty shitty, because the only way for us to defend ourselves would be to lay out the things that the users have done that they were banned for, which seems like a shitty thing to do since it would generally compromise their ability to post here. It would also be an additional tax on our time, and believe it or not, we already spend enough time moderating.

Reading through feminist history and the depression era, there was a massive scaling back on women's rights in the workplace during the great depression.

Which suggests that upcoming automation will hit women first, along with some supposed solutions. Yet, I can't help but think this is going to be part of a larger problem, with female dominated jobs just the first on the chopping block (transportation, most likely to be effected after the legislation for self-driving vehicles WITHOUT a driver is approved, is significantly male dominated).

In the next 5-15 years, expect the following fields to be partially or totally eliminated (and a majority of jobs that are held by women):

Field | % Women working
------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------
Secretaries and administrative assistants | 94.7%
Cashiers | 74.3%

General office clerks | 81.4%
Bookkeeping, accounting and auditing clerks | 87.1%
Receptionists & Help desk | 89.8%

Jobs not at risk are typically in the field of child care and personal support. I greatly encourage readers to check page 17 of the actual report to see the full breakdown and other statistics, and to compare and contrast with the chart just below it showing majority male jobs.

This movement is being compared heavily to the automation and outsourcing of previously majority-female textile jobs which, while being in awful conditions, nonetheless offered itself to greater female autonomy.

Furthermore, it's worth noting that low-skill male jobs like driving and construction are at-risk as well, but nonetheless either delayed (as I mentioned earlier, courtesy of legislation) or offset (most construction work is mid-skill rather than low-skill). Those highest paying jobs (and many would argue, highest-skill) overall like executive and software work still have a high tendency to be male and least likely to be automated away. 

Those mid-skill jobs like supervisors are much less likely to be automated and have a decent chunk of women in them already, however it's worth noting that more than anything this sudden freeing of labor is going to force displaced workers to compete with high-skilled workers with years of experience on them and of course, increase the labor supply in those fields which will naturally drive wages and benefits down.

I'm sure everyone is familiar with Philip Bunce but for those who don't know - Philip Bunce is a senior director at Credit Suisse who was awarded a place on a list of the Top 100 women in business. This made headlines because by his own admission, Bunce is not a trans woman and doesn't wish to be viewed as such, he just wears women's clothes a few days a week. 

When I read this story I couldn't believe the ridiculousness of it - how can a cross-dressing man take up space on this list instead of a woman? It seems there is a pretty clear cut solution in this case - he should be on the man's list. He by all accounts - including his own - is male. Surely trans people would agree with this also..?

Then I started thinking about how Caitlyn Jenner was named woman of the year a few years back, and how some feminists had a problem with it / still do. I would never say it out loud for fear of sounding transphobic, but I can't shake the feeling that there's something not quite right about a person who has lived nearly all of their adult life as a man, transitions then gets awarded woman of the year. Especially given the problematic person she is.

Similarly, when Munroe Bergdorf was hired as a key-note speaker for the BFI's Women With a Movie Camera summit there was an inevitable backlash from radical feminists who felt the opportunity was taken away from a woman with more experience. Although I respect Bergdorf and she has helped me understand so many trans issues, I understood why they felt this way.

The problem is, I can't see a fairer way. What's the answer? To create a 3rd category / award for trans people? What about trans women who are not openly ""out"" as trans, are female on their birth certificates and look very feminine? Everyone would see them as biologically female and there's no way of proving or disproving this - what are we going to do, demand to look at everyone's genitals / medical records?

She asked the mom's group about how to handle this situation, and she was resoundingly told that she's transphobic for not dating ""him"" and that not all men have penises, and to exclusively date men who do have penises makes you transphobic. The pushy and aggressive behavior was totally glossed over in the attack on this poor woman for not wanting to get in bed with this person. What. In. The. Everloving... So you're going to call yourselves a bunch of feminists, while telling someone that they should be having a sexual experience with someone who makes them uncomfortable?

AND they said that I was morally obligated to prove my bigoted claims, otherwise I was the granny of all bigots from Bigotland. I sent them links from several sources showing that legalization of prostitution increases trafficking. ""Well, that just means fine tuning is in order."" Then I get the whole ""feminists conflate ordinary Playboy with hardcore violent porn."" I sent some links about Hugh Hefner's actual thoughts on women, and explained that even if there are different levels of porn, there are still problems at every level. Back to sex work. ""There are tons of shitty jobs out there. Why are we singling sex work out?""

I try explaining that sure, there are shitty jobs out there. But prostitution depends on human trafficking, violence, slavery, underage girls, disabled women (oh yes) and sometimes outright murder to survive as a business. Even with legalization. Even if even if even if. If you're going to tell me it's just a matter of fine tuning then I'm going to say YOU are morally obligated to tell me what magic little regulation will fix everything. 

Some asshole thought he was being crafty by telling me about nail salons that also trafficked their workers. I pointed out that since those salons are indeed legal and regulated, that's strong evidence to say that it doesn't work for prostitution where customers want to be anonymous and KNOW the prostitutes are underage, exploited, and don't want to be there. When nail salons were exposed, several states in the Northeast did a fast and furious sweep, shutting many of them down in under a month. (This also shows that it's really not hard to shut down a trafficking ring. You just need to get out of your swivel chair and do it). Amazingly, the ""massage parlors"" were left untouched. Male politicians got to look like white knights while still protecting their favorite brothels. 

The truth is, women really don't want to be in prostitution. Naive young women in their gap year don't stay in it for long once they see that it's not what Diablo Cody said it would be. If men want this unicorn of a woman who truly enjoys prostitution, and meets their standards of fuckability, she'd be so rare and so expensive that only billionaires could afford to have tea with her.

I just love when a movie or a show has a majority of women cast. The same goes for Star Trek Discovery series, ladies carry the narrative and the action. The Handmaid's Tale is coming here soon and since we are all banned from that subreddit maybe we can continue commenting here?",0,1555520491.0,bea84b,21,GenderCritical
2821,"To start off, I don?t know how to put this into words but I am so fucking happy and relieved that I found this subreddit. This might be long but I?m feeling a little emotional, I apologize.

I?ve found myself growing so disillusioned with liberal feminism in the past 3 years, it started when I decided to finally come out about being sex trafficked and abused by my ex boyfriend when I was 15-16, ?intersectionality? told me that I would be believed (or at least listened to). After I told a couple people I was closest to in real life, I decided to try to bring awareness to the very fucking real epidemic that is sex trafficking. I wasn?t a ?sex worker?, I wasn?t ?empowered?, i was a vulnerable teenager who was being beaten and raped. 

I wanted to be anonymous about it to protect myself and my image (because while I thought it was important, I was still afraid that coming out about rape is not the hug/cry/love fest we?re told it is) so I tried posting about it on twox, I was called a SWERF. I didn?t even know what the fuck that meant. I was victim blamed for not telling the police about the rape when my parents made me take him to court for a restraining order (i only got a no contact order and he stalked me until I moved out of the state almost 3 years later lol). 

After that I started seeing the glaring cracks in their ideology; lesbians being shamed for not wanting to sleep with someone who has a dick, ?sex positivity? being burdened by a rhetoric that pushes the liability upon violated women to ?liberate? ourselves as if we?re prisoners of our own minds and nothing else, forcing us to adapt to mens desires even if it HURTS because well golly, saying no to a specific sex act must mean you?re not a Cool Girl! In my relationships with men I was told to just accept their pornography addictions and disgusting fucking fetishes, because that?s all fine and good! Doesn?t matter if it hurts me because it?s something that brings men pleasure! If I say it makes me deeply uncomfortable that must mean i?m an insecure, controlling hag! Not wanting to engage in polyamory means I?m stifling my partners ?natural sexual urges?, I?m sorry but for me, personally, I?m okay with monogamy. Because I?m bisexual that automatically mean I?d date a trans person? No? Well I guess I must be an evil bigot who?s not deserving of love.  Telling women that we NEED to be standing up and saying ?no? to behavior that harms us while shaming us for having the gall to do so when it doesn?t fit a certain worldview. 

I could go on but holy shit it still pains me to this day that so many women are being lied to and spoon-fed this idea of ?tru intersectionality and acceptance!!!? and when they get kicked while they?re down by the same people who claim to support them, they just spit out the blood and keep coming back because the lengths women have been conditioned to go to for self preservation are terrifying.

I hope this made sense, I didn?t mean to rant but I want to thank everyone in this sub for providing a place where women don?t feel the need to censor ourselves.

EDIT: also the rape crisis center in this small ass southern town I live in, the one place I?d find any sort of real life solidarity, has been taken over by gender politics and trans people dominate nearly every conversation.

There's been a lot of mud-slinging on Twitter this past week over a couple of issues: first, more about self-ID and women's sports, secondly some stuff around the recent article published in an Irish paper that (though largely pro trans) raised some legitimate questions about use of the word 'cis'.

I'm mostly too scared to even comment on these issues any more, but since these two points were getting largely sensible responses, I thought I'd weigh in. I didn't say anything remotely terrible (do we ever?) but in response to some naive and inaccurate comments that were getting 'likes' I did give my 2p worth.

This was pretty mild stuff on how it's just not accurate to claim that transwomen aren't at an advantage in female sport, and I also set some people straight on the actual reason why people who reject the idea of a gender binary don't like being called cis (no it isn't to do with the language, yes we know it's Latin). 

Anyway, an online friend of mine who is a libfem and with whom I share views on ALMOST EVERY OTHER ISSUE then went on a mad subtweeting spree about how 'hateful' and 'toxic' 'certain people' were with their views on these poor, oppressed women and how knowing that they hold these views is a sure sign that they must secretly be terrible human beings and probably homophobic too (!!!!).

I?d like to bring up something, that may be not precisely gender critical, but i?d like to discuss it from a radical feminist perspective.And that something is an american pop culture seen from the point of view of an european woman.Firstly I must admit, I actually don?t have a personal experience with US realities and only know United States from the media. And when it comes to a mainstream american entertaining industry, there are few things that are bothering me a little, because judging it by my living experience they seem a bit peculiar.

The first is the absolute lack of interracial couples in movies/series that are not about racism. As if the only allowed interracial relationship in an american movie was a white man and an asian woman.

The second is the absolute lack of female sports in movies/series that take part in american high schools. It really looks like if an american girl wants to move a little, her only option is to become a cheerleader? which I consider a really weird way how to sexualise underage girls.

So my questions are:

1. What, the hell, is this? How've it becamesuch a huge phenomenon?

2832,"I?ve been thinking about this a lot, and I?m really curious what other GC/radical feminists think. There are a lot of elements of drag that frankly, make me uncomfortable, and even come off as misogynistic. So much of it is based off of **extreme** femininity and/or gender roles. Not only is there the ?costume? aspect - but they also change their behavior when performing in drag. A lot of it is talking like a ?ditz?, playing stupid, acting promiscuous, unrealistic high pitched voice, and exaggerated mannerisms that are ?feminine.? They?re essentially dressing up as misogynistic stereotypes of how they view femininity - especially when you compare it to the drag that women (rarely) do as men. Their drag is often just beards and talking with a low voice - while men are acting stupid/ditzy/overly sexual. Donning huge wigs, fake breasts, revealing clothing, pounds of makeup, heels, etc. 

I might be totally wrong with my interpretation of drag - maybe someone could explain it to me. I?ve never understood. But to me, it just comes off as men performing extreme gendered roles and essentially making fun of femininity. So much of it seems like they are mocking woman - not paying ?homage? to them. My guess is that their defense would be: ?they aren?t mocking femininity! - because what they are performing is such an ?exaggerated? cartoonish version of womanhood that it?s actually ?mocking the patriarchy and gender roles!?

I am a sixteen year old male who was drawn into reddit's trans-community after I found out I was attracted to other men. For almost an six months I questioned whether or not I was transgender with the support of reddit's trans' subs and people I met on those subs. I now believe these subreddits are dangerous. 

I was depressed and isolated and the community drew me in by offering what seemed to be a solution to all of the problems that had been plaguing me. Anytime I questioned whether I was making the right decision, an army of users would tell me that being trans was the right way to deal with my issues. The community is cult-like. It is too easy for a depressed and directionless teenager to be drawn into these communities. The subreddits themselves are a breeding ground for pedophillic relationships, something I, myself, experienced. Older trans identifying males* are more than happy to ""advise"" younger people struggling with what is clearly not gender dysphoria, but mental illness. This seemingly innocent relationship, for me, quickly turned into an exploitative pedophillic one.

I dont' have the goddamn time to pick up after him either. I'm not his mother and if he treats his mom this way, he owes her an apology.

He gets right up in my face, calls me a manipulative cunt who's been taking advantage of him this whole year because I spent too much on amazon which is money I could be giving him for rent, and when I tell him to not worry about the rent and just move out for may 1 and I'll figure the rest out, he looks at me in a way that I've never seen before, calls me a bitch, and tells me to go fuck myself. I've never seen anyone look at me like that before. It was pure contemptuous rage and hatred. I thought he was going to spit on me. He was right up in my face and he is a LOT bigger than me and I know he's unstable (currently uncontrolled BPD). I can't get that look out of my head. I'm not sitting on the front porch without shoes or a jacket because I'm too anxious to go back inside. What do I DO? How am I supposed to live with him for another three or four weeks? He seriously scared me but he didn't technically threaten me so I don't even think I can reasonably call the police. I just don't know what to do.

He said he's been fighting this for a few years and now the college he attends will no longer assist him and the accused is now pressing retaliative charges. 

This is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that he's going on and on, posting in MRA subs insisting this is a ""gendered"" issue and that he is being discriminated against as a male. He seems convinced that a woman would have had this dealt with years ago when it happened. He is also shocked at the level of backlash he has gotten for coming out about it and is angrily posting on the MRA subs about it.

So...I just don't get it. This is not a ""gendered"" issue. I'm a victim of rape, female, my attacker was male and I was so horribly harassed and defamed for coming out about it that I can no longer have non-anonymous social media accounts for my own safety and mental health. 

My rape also happened 3 years ago, I told two people about it and even that caused enough of a shit-storm that I was bullied behind my back and had people of the rapist's friend group come into my place of work and attempt to soil my name to my coworkers when I was not on shift. Thankfully, my coworkers stood up for me and told me what happened.

When I officially named the rapist, he threatened to sue me for defamation. Similar to what this dude is saying happened to him, retaliative charges. 

My university also knew about the entire situation as it was unfolding. They told me to get off of social media to avoid harassment but the only option they gave me for charges was to perform a ""he said, she said"" type of testimony, compare the events, and then have two student volunteers decide who they believed. I opted out of that because it sounded risky due to very little evidence that I had and time elapsed since the event. So, no charges were ever pressed. I also do understand that it would be wrong to convict him of something based on just my testimony. That's not a precedent that should be set.

He never ended up suing me but he's gone about his life pretty much unaffected. I get to walk around knowing people hate me for calling their friend a rapist. Since it was made public, I have no idea who knows and who doesn't, so when people talk to me, I just have to guess whether or not they're being fake-nice to me or will try to backstab me like so many others. I've also had local news stations contact me repeatedly asking invasive questions, when I told them I didn't want to participate in their article and would appreciate it if they weren't written at all, I was told the article would be written no matter what but it'd be better for me if I participated, otherwise they'd just publish his side.

I also used to be under the illusion that victims of rape get compassion, part of the reason I came out about it was because I wasn't sure that the young men and women talking shit actually knew why the rapist hated me, or whether or not they knew about the rape. I thought people *didn't* know and were trashing me because of something false the rapist said. 

That was not the case, they knew the entire time about the rape and *that* was why they hated me. So, there was no compassion from men *or* women locally. 

I got trauma counseling and learned that *all* of my counselor's patients who are victims of rape were harassed on some level and threatened with defamation lawsuits by the accused. All of them.

The *statistical conflation of criminal behavior between the sexes* is *not* a gap that handmaidens should laud as ~progressive~ to 'fix'. It's just dragging actual women down in the shittiest of ways.

On a related note, I keep seeing studies of women's opinions where men (TIMs) were also answering as 'women'. This is wrong for a number of reasons. Men shouldn't be speaking as women on anything-- as trans'women', fine, but not as actual women. This ~progressive~ movement is slowly driving actual women out of their careers, out of their own politics, out of having their own voices in general.

It is also fundamental to understanding the overlap between butch women (who have taken on a social role which subjects them to such constant attempts at humiliating them) and trans men, and why gender non-conforming female people who are already marginalized from social existence through disability (particularly, highly socially relevant disabilities like autism) or through being otherwise deeply othered (being part of a racially stigmatized group, particularly in a white-dominant area; being fat; being intersex, especially visibly so; being working-class or in poverty; etc.) often live on the very edge of ?normal society? or have fallen off completely, in near- or total isolation from others and making unintelligible decisions.

That anyone who *doesn?t* transition is ?repressing? who they are.  They took offense to someone else saying that some women  ?cope? with their own ?dysphoria? by becoming ?T*RFs.? Leaving aside whether that other person was correct or not, I want to focus on the response.  

How fucking arrogant and closed-minded do you have to be to think that *only trans people* ever feel anything like this ineffable dysphoria that they never shut up about? And that there is literally only one treatment which can make its sufferers feel any better, and that is to ?transition? your life away from the sex that you were born.  They really do think that Cis people are just floating happy and carefree in their perfect bodies and their perfect minds and no one ever suffers anything close to the  *pain of being dysphoric.* Like a woman has never looked at her bigger than average feet and thought that they felt like ?male? feet and that she hated them. Or the size of her arms, and hearing people whisper that she looked like a linebacker, and she cried herself to sleep that night and many others.  That they didn?t lay awake in their bodies wishing they could wake up in a *more* ?female?, dainty, beautiful, slender, *perfect* body than the terrible one that they were cursed with. No? that never happens.  

No one is else ever suffers from the idealization of certain gender characteristics that they don?t exhibit.  And if they do, that *means* they are trans!! So that little girl who feels like her body is betraying her because it?s not ?feminine? enough? she should *transition*! Or else she?s ?repressing? who she really is! But who, pray tell, should she ?transition? to? The more ?feminine? person she dreams she could be? Should we encourage this 12 yo to get liposuction and breast implants and figure out surgery to make shoulders less broad so she doesn?t have to feel this dysphoria? We couldn?t treat the underlying insecurities and try to help her learn to love the body she has; that would be conversion therapy. What if female puberty doesn?t make it better? Maybe we should encourage her to repress her natural hormones and take synthetic ones, so she can control exactly how her body develops and stop anything she doesn?t like from occurring, even if it makes her sterile? because her 12 yo self should definitely be in control of that. 

Watch them say I?m exaggerating or lying or building a strawman.  How can my life be a strawman? I used to lie in bed crying because I wasn?t *enough* of a girl? because I hated the parts of myself that I saw as ?too masculine.?  Are they going to say that wasn?t dysphoria that they go on and in about? How would they want that treated if anything that isn?t affirming is verboten? I was born female and am female and was a girl and am a woman.  I learned to accept the parts of myself that I hated as a child (or am at least trying)? because they are a part of me. Now I?m not saying that will work on every single person; but who the fuck are they to say that it can?t work on any of them.

That true masculinity isn?t fragile and doesn?t have to be toxic.  That they are in a position to help change how the world treats both men and women and to be as cognizant of the differences in how they are treated and how they treat other men and boys and how they treat women and girls. 

That we want little girls who feel ?masculine? to feel supported that however they feel and however they look? that IS feminine because they are female; that the ?ideal? is a repressive social construct created to keep them from feeling happy and confident in themselves as they are. That they are free to wear what they want to wear and do what they want to do and be who they want to be, and love who they want to love and all of that, no matter how it presents, is feminine because they are women.

* That we're too childish to make serious decisions, and thus shouldn't be given nearly as full bodily autonomy as men (for instance, when we need birth control, want to be sterilized, want/need an abortion, etc.)
* That our careers/interests/individuality should be sidelined so that we can better focus on the needs of a male partner/children
* That we should simply expect and make peace with the fact that we'll probably be sexually harassed, or worse, at some point in our lives (often as children, by older men)
* That we need to make ourselves look like sexed-up Barbie dolls if we hope to attract anyone, whereas men can still be viewed as ""attractive enough"" even if they dress like dumpster rats and don't have proper hygiene
* That our spirits will be crushed, whether by an abusive partner, pedophilic culture, religious tradition, or **our inherent vulnerability as people with the ability (or perceived ability) to get pregnant**.  We can't be free to feel the wind in our hair without some force quickly pulling us back down to earth and reminding us that virtually everyone/everything wants to exploit us.

I'm sure that a lot of people who self-ID as trans men are trying to avoid the aforementioned shit, and very understandably so.

Over the years he has changed the rules regarding access to accommodate requests.  If memory serves me, it started out as being only for women and was later expanded to women and their male guests.  At some point a security system was installed and codes would be issued only to women.  So of course the codes were shared and the rule became mostly unenforceable.  I stopped going when it became clear men were not going to be kept out despite the rules and requests.  Fast forward to 2019.  The rule in place was no men after 9pm.  It wasn't being respected, some dudes may have gotten kicked out (uncertain about this).  The rule was posted at the entrance along with the dictionary definition of woman.  The signs (on private property!) have been torn down and the entrance has been vandalized.  This freely shared community space that has been used mostly by women as an urban zen retreat since at least the early/mid 90s is now closed.  Below is the exchange between a friend of mine and the owner.  I have deleted their names and the location.

I?m just guessing by the latest signage. It also looks like there is some name-calling (transphobic) happening, and I?m really sorry to see that.

2892,"While catching up on some research today I happened to come across a few [journal](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44289984) [articles](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43669854) (behind a paywall, alas) by a UC Irvine researcher studying transgender prison populations. A lot of really good qualitative interviews on how TIM inmates perceive and perform gender. Well I was *floored* to learn that, at least in CA, despite the enormous rates of sexual assault (58.5%) and ""sexual misconduct"" (69.4%) they experience, the overwhelming majority of trans-identified males (64.9%) prefer to stay in men's prisons over women's (35.1%). According to them, the desire for the validation and sex that men provide them (and the desire to avoid actual women) explicitly outweighs their desire to stay safe!

I literally cannot fathom *preferring* such an extreme likelihood of being raped just because you want the chance to bag a man and girls are ""too much drama!"" My jaw is on the floor. I feel so angry that ANYONE would call someone like this a woman, would suggest that our experiences have ANYTHING in common. These people feel more unlike me than even men do!

Also worth noting: this researcher [didn't find any statistically significant difference](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/similar-assault-rates-regardless-of-housing-1.png) in rates of sexual assault between those in men's prisons and those in transgender-only units. In other words they rape each other almost as much as the men do. In fact the [only predictive risk factor](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/predictive-factors-sexual-assault-prison-1.png) they could find for sexual assault were having had a sexual or ""marriage-like"" relationship with a man. As always, dating men is one of the biggest risk factors for sexual assault.

It's become verboten to talk about the possibility that trans-identified males really are as predatory as any other male, but I feel like this really demonstrates the lengths to which a *large* percentage of them are willing to go in order to achieve sexual gratification and validation about their gender identity. Looking at this shocking data, how could anyone doubt that a similarly huge percentage of TIMs trying to transfer into women's prisons are trying to do so in order to gain sexual access to women?

What is WITH this need to get people to fuck you in order to validate your identity?!?!?! It's apparently rampant within the trans community and I literally can't understand it!

Equally shocking were the [blatantly misogynist reasons given](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/tims-prefer-mens-prison-details.png) for wanting to avoid the women's prison:

* ""It's easier. Women are more complicated. They like to fight and prove themselves. Too much drama.""
* ""It'd be too much with too many women?too much drama/gossip.""
* ""When girls get together, there is too much bickering?too much drama.""
* ""\[Women\] are viscous. They are worse than men. Their hormones are going all the time. Imagine being around 60 women and two are on their period at the same time! God. Imagine how bad that would be?""

At first I generously thought that perhaps they were solely projecting their negative experiences with other [hyper-competitive TIMs](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/fun-competition.png) onto actual women (and probably some of them are), but that last quote blew that theory out of the water. It's clear that there's a whole element of [toxic competition](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/men-take-care-of-you-if-youre-a-lady.png) here that spills over into putting down ""biologic"" women, the ""real deal."" They know they can never be us, so they have to tear us down and try to make themselves look better by comparison.

There's SO much more... it's like a bingo card of misogynist stereotypes and patriarchal myths. These attitudes need a whole essay of their own to unpack. My head is just reeling from how ass-backwards they see everything...

I decided to make the strap-on harnesses as a way to fund my advocacy work because they're relatively inexpensive and quick to make. I've been selling them on Etsy, and I've had a couple of different adult inclusive stores make orders as well. All of the money that I'm making is to help make school space more inclusive. The harness itself is made out of polypropylene webbing in a variety of colours?the fan favourite is rainbow. The metal snap makes it so the O ring can be replaced with a different size. The buckles are the exact same buckles that you would use on a backpack to tighten those straps over your shoulder, and because of that, you're able to fit literally any type of person.

So I've worked with a friend who's a physiotherapist, who's given me some pictures on how long to make straps, so that they're easier to grab for somebody with mobility issues and lost muscle tone. So that's in the works for probably a few months from now. I'd like to collaborate with people who have disabilities first, before putting it out, because I?m able bodied and recognize that.

In my dream world, if this becomes as big as I hope it does, I?d be traveling around to different schools to do presentations for teachers, because they're often the biggest problem in all of this?students have fewer issues with being accepting. **Teachers take a little bit more time to reprogram**.

With all the different schools I?ve taught at, there?s always been at least one, if not two or three, trans or gender non-conforming kids in a class. I know that, at least for myself, being trans here was never really an option until they saw someone living authentically as themselves. **Not that I gave them permission to be out as trans, but I think seeing themselves represented gave themselves permission. So one of the things that I'm noticing is that there are trans students everywhere.** When they have a safe space, they actually starting to come out, but when that space isn?t safe, they don?t?for their own safety.

2913,"Hi everyone. For context, I am a reddit ""poweruser"" who used to get angry about the transphobia I saw on reddit and elsewhere until very recently. In fact, I never imagined that I would ever adopt a belief that separates men and women, as more or less any study on reducing bigotry finds that lumping people together as opposed to separating them into 'us' and 'them' is the way to reduce bigotry. The bounds of 'us' and 'them' are socially-defined; however, because traits like race, ethnicity, and gender give rise to traits that are visibly identifiable, they are by far  the easiest ways to define 'us' and 'them', and powerful individuals and groups across cultures exploit this in order to gain control over others.

I have been aware of GC feminism for a long time, but one day, for some reason, I decided to stop and read it instead of just reacting against it. It confirmed things that I have observed from years of following various groups online (e.g. porn sickness, the social spread of trans identification, the muddling of women's issues by activism that perpetuates extremely harmful stereotypes about women, e.g. 'spoonies', fat activism) in addition to helping me understand some of my own deep-rooted behaviors - behaviors that, in context, were clearly the result of a socially-imposed aversion to displaying any female-typical thoughts and behaviors (i.e. 'weak' and 'emotional' thoughts and behaviors) - in addition to extreme internalized misogyny that caused me to stereotype and even loathe 'woman' as a concept for most of my life, despite the fact that most of my friends at that time were girls who clearly didn't fit that mold.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I've been allergic to the idea of feminism for most of my life. I hand-waved GC and radical feminism when I initially learned about it as a reaction to the idea of bigotry against an oppressed group of people (i.e. transwomen). And honestly, I do still believe that some people do experience a medical phenomenon that causes them to feel like they are in the wrong body, without any AGP or fantasy involved, and that transitioning may help them. However, it's clear that the vast majority of 'trans' and 'genderqueer' people are being influenced to transition for reasons that do not necessitate pumping their body with hormones and spending all of their free time on twitter and reddit.

&#x200B;

My interest in radical feminism has come on very quickly and strongly, which, as somebody who dislikes established social and political movements, radicalism, and the idea of putting people into arbitrary groups based primarily upon what division(s) can most benefit the people in charge, is very unfamiliar.

&#x200B;

I think my attraction towards radical/gender critical 'feminism' was cemented when I visited a 'feminist' bookstore this weekend. The speakers that were hosted there are very anti-idpol, but the books and trinkets...there was barely a book there about the condition of women and girls. I am completely serious. This feminist bookstore, which has been around for many years, had far more literature and paraphernalia related to gendershit than women and girls. In addition, they carried a ton of literature that perpetuates ideas about female weakness in addition to other trash, e.g. 'spoonie' ""books"" and ""art"", 'fat positive' ""books"" and ""art"", sex work positive ""books"" and ""art"", porn positive ""books"" and ""art"", divisive women-of-one-race vs. women-of-other-race ""books"" and ""art"", new-age materialist 'witchy' garbage that is somehow almost as shallow and capitalistic than the telecommunications industry.

&#x200B;

Aside from a handful of publications from a couple mainstream artists, there was nothing, and I mean NOTHING there that actually contained a message about the empowerment of women and girls. Almost all of the literature clearly peddled damaging stereotypes about the weakness of women and girls. There was essentially nothing in this 'feminist bookstore' that would actually cause a fence-sitter to consider the idea that women aren't weak. In fact, just walking through those cursed shelves would demonstrate to them quite the opposite. That women need novels about how to understand how to give consent. That most women are mentally ill or 'spoonies' (i.e. have at least one chronic condition that prevent them from going about their day-to-day lives in a normal manner). That women who walk into a feminist bookstore are so stupid that they need $10 comic pamphlets straight off of tumblr to tell them how to hurl a corporate bath-bomb into some 'self-care' water. Though, of course, the vast majority of the content there was dedicated to gender. As I mentioned, the only content created by or for women in this established 'feminist' bookstore was mainstream content that the average person could pick up at a public library.

As a woman who is just starting to accept and celebrate her womanhood, and as somebody with some serious physical disabilities who tries to work around them like the average contemporary disabled person - spoonie/online disability 'culture' just perpetuates and accelerates the belief held prior to the 'handicapable' movement and onwards, where anybody who has a serious disability is thought of and treated like they're unable to function on a basic level - I found this bookstore sickening. The fact that they clearly care more about transwomen and 'genderqueer' people (the entire ""feminist"" shop was painted with affirming messages about transhit), the fact that most of their ""feminist"" publications revolved around topics that mentally kneecap the women who buy into them, and the fact that there were tons of teen girls in the shop was extremely disheartening.

Sorry for the rambling, but I needed to get my thoughts in order. The next day I went to a lefty conference and about 40% of the attendees were transwomen, some of whom were in extremely revealing clothing i.e. underwear)...at an academic conference. I'm somewhat glad they attended one of the many derivative 'queer theory' talks instead of the fantastic panel I was there for because they most certainly would have shouted it down for not having an intersectional enough group of speakers and for possessing an ideology that tries to empower all workers instead of prostrating towards each identity group one-by-one. At the same time, it would be very nice if transpeople were strongly encouraged to listen to legitimate theorists who don't feel the need to connect their ideas to gender theory.",0,1555230410.0,bd0r86,101,GenderCritical

I also really despise how this issue has brought misogynistic men crawling out of the woodwork who sneer at women's sports. There are a few true allies, but I get the feeling most men who bring up this issue are in no way doing so to protect women's sport, but to have a jab at how inferior women are to men. Using male versus female biology to voice barely concealed contempt toward us. Which, to me, is like a Cheetah bragging to idk a lion that he can run faster than she can. Yeah: we are fundamentally built differently. That's the point. We are a sexually dimorphic species. A man bragging that men are better than women is absurd, as you did nothing to earn that 10-30% advantage but be born. An example I saw of this was some conservative personality on Twitter posting a clip of women's collegiate basketball where some player missed an easy layup. Somehow, he made the leap to how the worst player in the NBA would be the best player in the WNBA (even though that had nothing to do with this random clip) and laughing about it. Like ha ha, see how weak and silly women's sport is compared to men. And the comments were just filled with people laughing at this clip and shitting all over the WNBA. The context was supposed to be about why men and women's sport is separated due to the trans issue, but turned into a shitfest of women generally.

So women are caught in a limbo of defending women's sport from XY people on two different fronts: by constantly stating over and over how different male and female biology differ and how that gives men a noticeable advantage over women; and then dealing with insincere men pretending to be allies who are really just using this issue to gloat about the biological differences between men and women.

Abstract

The activist conjunction of sexual orientation and gender identity is questioned by demonstrating how the concerns of the transgender movement run contrary to an agenda of liberation from gender ideology. The confused vocabulary of trans discourse articulated in the language of somatic incongruence (so-called gender dysphoria) is exposed, using an analysis of the concept of somatic incongruence and the various interventions through which bodies are apparently restored to ideological congruence constructed upon, inter alia, gender, race, and age. The paper rejects transgender medical treatment and surgery as nothing but the most brutal affirmation of gender stereotypes and, in conclusion, calls for a radical and total disaffirming of gender, analogous to the termination of racial classification and segregation.",0,1555193362.0,bcvwbb,29,GenderCritical

I identified as a trans guy from when I was ~13-18 (my current age) until I discovered radical feminism and learned about why I felt the way I did.

Throughout my teen years, I thought I must be trans because I hated being female with a passion that no female friend related to. I felt dissociated and detached from my body and everything feminine. My body felt - and still does - like a threat to myself and a permanent invitation for sexualization and rape. Most importantly to me, my sexuality *felt* male, because I had a visually-stimulated, ravenous sexual desire that didn't align with a feminine passive sexuality. Once in art class, when I made some nude art, my teacher told me I should instead make art that was more representative of female sexuality. I broke down because I didn't even know what that would look like. I was obsessed with male pleasure, and during sex with my boyfriends (another problem I still have) I could only get off by imagining what my boyfriend was experiencing. These ideas, and many others, all added up to a conclusion I was definitely a trans guy - but I think you all know where these ideas really come from.

I grew up with the understanding (as an itty bitty child!) that I was a girl, and it was a sad reality that boys were just /better/, and I needed to do what I could to make them happy with me. I grew up with a misogynistic father who sexualized me from a young age and taught me how to be a satisfactory female. He groomed me and isolated me from my mother over a long period of time, and this childhood has totally warped my view of gender roles and I'm still trying to work through it.

I was so happy to discover radical feminism and identify my internalized misogyny. I learned women don't have to fit into any gender role to be a woman.

However, my university is rated pretty high in LGBT friendly campuses in the US, and students staged a counter protest across campus. People who disagreed voiced their opinions during the talk. Cool, okay, fine, that?s their right.

HOWEVER, a student stood up in the middle of the talk, and sprayed a mixture of lavender oil, bleach, and other chemicals in this guy?s face. She was arrested, but a lot of people are praising her actions.

> Methods: 
Twelve transgender individuals, 6 trans women and 6 trans men who had been accepted to start gender-affirming medical intervention, were recruited. Knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry at three different angular velocities (0, 60 and 90 /s). The assessments were made at four time points: (T1) before treatment initiation, (T2) four weeks after initiated gonadal hormonal down regulation but before hormone replacement, (T3) three months after hormone replacement therapy and (T4) eleven months after hormone replacement therapy. The cross-sectional area and radiological density of the thigh muscles were assessed by CT scans performed bilaterally at the midpoint of femur of each subject at baseline and after 11 months of cross-sex hormone treatment.

> Results and Conclusions: 
**Muscle area increased 17% in trans men** (p<0.001) with an 8% increase in radiology density after eleven month of cross-sex hormone treatment. **No change was seen in trans women.** There were significant (P<0.05) group x time interactions at each angular velocity. Thus, **while the trans men increased their strength over the four time points, strength levels were generally maintained in the trans women.** When averaging the three strength tests, knee extension (16%) and knee flexion (34%) strength increased from T1 to T4 in trans men. The corresponding changes in the trans women group were -6% and 0%, respectively. 

>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ~1 year of cross-sex hormone treatment results in increased muscle strength in trans men. Cross-sectional area and radiological density is also increased after testosterone treatment. However,** trans women maintain their strength levels as well as cross-sectional area and radiological density throughout the treatment period.** We conclude that the altered sex hormone pattern induced by gender-affirming treatment differentially affect muscle strength in trans men vs. trans women.",0,1555093134.0,bcgw69,608,GenderCritical

So first I guess my background. I am male, and have been transitioning waaaaay before ""bathroom bills"" were even a discussion. And I share so much of the sentiment this subreddit has about trans activism. 

1. The dangers of puberty blockers. Those things are often off brand cancer medications for Christ's sake. No wonder they have horrible side effects ruining bone density and cardiovascular health among others. 

2. The blatant disregard for the fact of biological reality. 
2.A - I have XY chromosomes, no matter how I Identify and no matter what I do with my life. I will have specific dispositions towards health because of that, and it cannot be ignored.
2.B - Even after SRS, saying that the neovagina is the exact same as a vagina is completely delusional. And I might add completely evil. Reducing a vagina to ""A F*ck hole"" is demeaning, objectifying, and wrong. It is a complete misunderstanding of female anatomy, and just shows how the vast majority of men in society don't care about 50% of the population.
2.C - Anything equating me to women is erasure of women. For Christ's sake, there is a problem when society associates ""Long hair, Pretty dress"" with ""Women"" than ""Vagina"" I don't belong in your spaces. I don't belong in your sports, I don't belong in your shelters. 

3. Disreguard for the permanency of medicines used. 
3.A - I am now at a permanent increased risk of seizures and other neurological disorders. I was aware of the risks when I signed up, and even developed schizophrenia later in life (Related or not, I don't know) but the majority of today's society treats it like damn magic.
3.B - Permanent changes to my cellular metabolism, especially in connective tissues and bone tissues. I have modified my diet to be Vitamin D and calcium and phosphate rich because of this, and I knew the risks when I signed up. And yet again, everyone in trans activism sees these pills as damn magic.
3.C - These pills aren't designed for transitioning. Spironolactone, the most popular testosterone blocker, is an off brand acne medication. Estradiol, Progestin, those are often off brand menopause medication. They have health side effects when used outside of their intended use. 

4. Enforcing gender roles.
There is nothing inherent about women that is ""feminine,"" and I can testify growing up surrounded by women who were rock climbers, boxers, mechanics, etc, femininity was designed to inhibit the potential of the women in this society. 
When I first began to transition, there was a lot of questions like ""Why do you want to be a woman in this society?"" Nothing! Hell, you women are treated like shit in this society. Men never leave you alone, doctors ignore you, and employers are already biased against you. 
Removing the transition from ""Body"" to ""Performative"" is enforcement of gender roles, and enforcement of patriarchy. There is a generation of people growing up right now who will regret their decisions to transition when older. I have never met a trans MtF who wasn't an absolute perv about women, and it disgusts me. I've never met a trans MtF who couldn't think of women outside of their performative gender roles, and it is abhorrent. 
I hate how trans activism enforces gender roles, lets men into women's very much needed spaces, and erases women.

So many men are victim blaming, in so many ways.  Others are just dismissing the rape allegations as unimportant, suggesting that if JA did rape the women as alleged, it doesn't really matter because he did a thing they approve of.  

The denial of rape is MASSIVE:  the amount of misinformation is huge & it's a demonstration of how the narrative has been shifted from 'JA is wanted to face rape allegations' to 'Poor JA is being persecuted by the UK on behalf of the US'.

2953,"I usually complain about how the trans ideology appropriates and denigrates womanhood, but I had some thoughts as to how the trans community harms its own people aside from that.

The first is that it preys on a very emotionally vulnerable crowd - teenagers. As we all know, no matter how you identify, your teenage years are a turbulent emotional time. Woman or man, hetero or queer, there's going to be rough sailing ahead. Certainly some have it easier than others, but I'm pretty sure that nobody makes it through their teenage years without some turmoil over who they are or what's their place in society.

Now enter the trans community. Vulnerable, questioning teenagers are told in no uncertain terms that if they do not start transitioning NOW, it will be harder later on. ""The longer you wait, the harder it is"" is practically a trans mantra. There's a rush to send these teenagers onto hormones as quickly as possible, or blockers at the very least. Unfortunately, HRT has a number of side-effects that will not go away even if you stop taking it. Men may become permanently sterile after only a few months on HRT. There may be physical changes that can never return to normal if you stop. Women's voices may become permanently deeper. The list goes on. It's a huge decision that the trans community encourages rushing people into, because the clock is ticking.

HRT is often ascribed almost magical properties by people early in transition, as if it's a wonder pill that sends you from man to woman in a reasonable time frame. Many of them soon realize that it doesn't do all that, and for some people, they may show little to no effect even after taking HRT for a year or more. It will soon set in for most TIMs that they will never pass as a woman.

And of course, passing is everything in the trans community. Those who don't pass often suffer crippling dysphoria as they're kind of stuck in between - not a woman, just a ""guy in a dress."" Unfortunately for them, most trans women will never pass. Even if they get expensive surgery after expensive surgery. Admittedly, some do a good job of it, but that's because they had androgynous features to begin with.

Nevertheless, the trans community sets these vulnerable teenagers on this path to disaster, full of permanent repercussions, often with the insistence that it must be done now and forget what your parents or even your psychologist has to say about it. If your psychologist doesn't approve, find another that will. I saw a post recently where a TIM talked about going through four psychologists until they found one who would approve of HRT.

Why does this happen? Well, I think you get these TIMs who have invested so much of their life into the trans identity that they can't possibly imagine that they could be wrong. They've sterilized themselves with hormones, they've isolated their families and social groups, perhaps they've even mutilated their bodies with surgery. It's not easy to look back on that and say ""I was wrong - I permanently disfigured my body because of a fetish or a mental condition."" The only option is to press forward. Some even deny that detransitioners exist and that detransition stories are just false flag propaganda by evil TERFs. I think they know, deep down, that the allegation is false but they desperately cling to this idea because the alternative is far worse.

My next problem is that TRAs have basically subsumed gender non-conforming and non-binary people into their trans umbrella. I love gender non-conforming people, especially GNC men. It's great to step outside of the confines of gender roles and experience something individualistic.

They dominate conversations, they?re condescending, domineering, and inappropriate. One on one, they make inappropriate comments about what we wear, about those with a marginalized ethnic identities, and constantly stifle women?s opportunities and growth. And none of us feel comfortable saying anything just yet because the department chair is male and a condescending prick and is one of the problem faculty.

My graduate cohort is a large cohort that, for the first time in a long time, is an all female cohort. And we are a staunch feminist group. We?ve sat in classes and collaborated on research together for some time now. Not all of us are radfems, but still they center women in their feminism for the most part.

We had a new male professor teaching adjunct last quarter and he was a dream. He was so humble, he gave space for us all to talk, was gentle and kind when he was challenging us to think about things differently. He was one of the best male profs we had ever had. When it came time to give our evaluations of him as a professor, we were told that it would factor into getting him a permanent job. Now, the thing with professor evals is that for those who have tenure, it basically doesn?t matter what the evals say bc the department doesn?t read them once tenure is given. But since our professor was new, they were paying special attention to his evaluations. With this opportunity, all of us absolutely laid into the department in our evals and wrote about how the males in the department are essentially assholes and that our new prof was one of the best things to happen to this department in a long time and he should absolutely be hired.

Our new prof was so concerned that he actually asked the department chair (male, condescending asshole) and the grad school director (female, amazing academic) to read the evals earlier than they normally would have (summer time) because he thought it was concerning that our all-female cohort universally had these experiences. This prompted our female grad school director to call a meeting with another strong, female professor, and they want to open up space for us to talk about sexism in the department and lay some groundwork for taking action about it.

I also discovered this sub about a month ago. And I?ve been trying to figure out how to do right by my son and by women and radfems.  

I always knew if I had a girl that I would let her choose what she was interested in and help protect her from ?pink? and princess culture, (but try to let her choose what she wanted to some extent if she chose that).   My sister has two girls and is having a bit of trouble with the fact that her 2 yo old *wants* to wear pink and princessy things, even though she?s literally never seen a Disney movie in her life and her toys are almost entirely primary colors (or full spectrum pastels) and gender neutral? my sister isn?t quite sure where the pink influence it is coming from.  My sister is struggling whether it?s feminist to buy her daughter the things she chooses when given a choice (pink sparkles) or to ?force? more ?gender neutral? colors and selections.  My sister tries to go ?neutral? with animals and dinosaurs and astronauts, but it is hard to figure out the balance without accidentally denigrating  ?girly? things as less than the ?boy? things.   It sounds easy but it?s proving difficult in practice. 

But reading this description of a 3 yo boy ?presenting female?, the feminist in me is saying, what does that even mean? That he wants to wear sparkles and tutus? What are they teaching him that he *cant do* as a boy? 

So for my own son, what does that mean? I go through my siblings? daughters? handmedown baby clothes for the gender neutral clothes ? should I be mixing it up? **Should I be dressing my baby boy in ruffles and pink onesies occasionally?** I do tend to lean heavily on sports and dinosaurs themes, because I think they are adorable.  But I do dress my baby boy *as* a baby boy and I don?t take the clearly baby girl clothes. And I would dress a baby girl in the same things, but with a splash of some more ?feminine? clothes. Should I be doing the same for my son? Should I dress him in the little strawberry outfit with the cute ruffles? Which is being a better radfem? I know pink and blue are not historically linked either way, but the clothes of today *are* gendered, and I?m the one doing the choosing.  What am I supposed to choose? Just boring primary colors to avoid all of it? But I have access to lots of free, gendered clothing and the plain primary colors clothes are actually much more expensive. 

Do I go out of my way to buy ?girl? toys? Not gender neutral toys, like puzzles and blocks and animals (he?ll already have those) and not even just dolls, but pink dolls? And I remember things things like my playdoh flower making basket? my brother didn?t have one of those.  And I loved mine. But there is nothing inherently ?not boy? about flowers (or there shouldn?t be). He shouldn?t think he needs to be a girl to play with that. So do I go out of my way to have balanced toy choices (not just neutral) so that he doesn?t think he needs to ask specifically for ?girl things?? Do I try to take bias out of it by already presenting it to him as *for* him?

I'm a scientist and a woman and this reaction really enrages and sickens me for so many reasons. I've done work with media people and outreach and this situation is horrible. I had to rant somewhere.

Firstly, the journalists are to blame for misinformation. When she gets inevitably doxxed I hope she calls them out on this. In all her interviews she is very clearly stating her place within a team and that her team is one of many. She did invent the very algorithm that creates the image and she is a team leader, but not the entire head of the project. The journalists keep captioning her as ""leader"" which is misinterpreted by others sharing the images. There's an obsession for journalists to find the head genius in any big science story and it drives scientists barmy:

&#x200B;

These huge projects are team efforts first and foremost. The official head of the project (Dr Heino Falcke) probably barely saw any of the code or even knows how it really works. But that's okay! Everyone contributes or you don't get authorship.

Secondly, the journalists know the public prefer to have a human perspective on a heavy scientific discovery. The black hole image is... Well, faceless so there is a frenzy to find something relatable amongst the equations and data. Dr Bouman is a gift to these journalists. In the world of scientific computing for radio satellites, she is young and pretty and witty in interviews. You'd think her PhD from MIT would be enough but remember it's how hot a woman is first and foremost. The public won't listen to female scientists unless they have sex appeal.

She had taken her own photos throughout the work, including ""the moment"" it all came together. She has experience giving a TED talk. The media storm around her is inevitable because the alternatives are frankly uninspiring on camera.

Angry Reddit misogynists have interpreted her outreach work as self-serving and I am truly dumbfounded. A person who wants to be internet famous and a celebrity does not get a PhD in imaging via physical model inversion.

To say scientists avoid media work like the plague is an understatement. My colleague's paper did well in the media and she locked herself in her office and cried at the prospect of being interviewed and photographed. My male colleagues are similar, and many scientists who know there will be a storm around their paper often flee abroad to avoid it entirely.

However, for many female scientists there is a sense of moral duty to do outreach work and try to engage with the public. Many of us had few role models and we are thinking of the young girls who need inspiration in a world that tells them they can't do maths. It's trying to give back, make things a bit better. In addition some of us truly enjoy our field and want to share it with others. When I see Dr Bouman's social media and talks it's the same vibe. She's not trying to be an Instagram influencer or get on Oprah.

I think most women don't enjoy being the token female scientist. I hate it when random people praise me for just working in a scientific field.  **This shouldn't be remarkable**. Getting media attention like this can feel like you're being pointed out as an anomaly rather discussing your contributions. So yes, women get media attention but it's hardly a privilege. It mostly feels like ""look at this female creature using her brain! Extraordinary!"" And again, first and foremost media cares about your sex appeal.

And finally as a computational scientist the GitHub sleuthing really got to me. The dude with 800k lines of ""code"" was mostly uploading lines of data, aka dogsbody work. Scientific programming is NOT software development. Dr Bouman's algorithm might be 10 lines long but it's the foundation and therefore a massive contribution to her team's work.

At some point last year I read a long form about the failure of Elizabeth Holmes' startup Theranos--how it was a medical startup that was basically way overpromising what it would be able to accomplish, and misrepresenting its progress till finally its failure to deliver anything was too much and it imploded. It had funding from all kinds of big investors in the Valley as well as a partnership at Walgreens at this point, so I can see how it made for a good bit of investigative journalism (apparently it was a reporter who first noticed things weren't adding up), but all in all, I wasn't that interested. It was more depressing than anything else. A woman gets buzz in Silicon Valley and it's because her company was a ""scam""? Great, just great.

Anyway, fast forward a few months and now YouTube's full of ""Theranos"" documentary recommendations for me. Apparently it's a captivating story for a good number of people out there. I ignored them at first until finally they wore me down and I decided to watch a professional-looking one. It's two guys talking about the company and Holmes and they restrained themselves for about a third of the video length till finally they come out with ""**the real politically incorrect reason behind her success is she charmed all those older men with her looks**""...and yeah....that's what I was afraid of. That's what I suspected was behind all this male interest in the story.

Look, maybe she's one of the most crooked people in the world. I really don't care. The point is whether she was successful or failed, it would have been the same story among the bros. ""She succeeded because she charmed all these men with her looks"" would have been the alternative buzz if she was successful. It's all about that male weakness for women that allows women to get ahead in tech and mess with men's otherwise perfect meritocracy (sarcasm). And she went around wearing black turtlenecks, minimal makeup, and natural-looking unfussy hair, for pete's sake.

Ugh, this is why I dress as conservatively as possible in my male-dominated field and I'm grateful to have a wedding ring (with my partner *not* in my field), which makes rumors more difficult. But stories like this remind me it doesn't matter--being female is enough to get you implicated for apparently not deserving whatever position you have--whether you ultimately succeed or fail.

I went to visit a family member who has a very liberal/progressive group of friends. They?re all queer, gender queer or GNC or non binary. He told me that one of his friends (whom I actually have known for years) has come to the conclusion that she is non-binary and that she doesn?t use she/her pronouns.

I?ve always thought I was really open minded and progressive, so I?ve actually been consciously trying to use singular ?they/them?more often bc I feel it?s polite and totally neutral. My response was ?ok great I can just use they/them? he told me no, that she doesn?t accept those pronouns. Her correct pronouns are ?per/pers? as in .... person. I was so confused bc she hasn?t changed anything, still wears the same clothes and has long hair. She?s most obviously female, and just labels as gender nonconforming. Also, she hasn?t changed her name and Its a woman?s name. People treat her the same and act the same around her. Changing pronouns doesn?t actually affect anything? So I started asking a bunch of questions such as ?well I?m not very feminine, is there criteria of being non binary? Am I non binary?? And he said no it?s something you just feel or identify with. 

If there?s no criteria, and gender is totally made up, why would it be offensive to just use female pronouns to go along with female body. I feel like it?s borderline offensive to think that bc you?re ?not like the other girls? that you are no longer a woman and don?t want to be referred to that way? How is that helpful in breaking down the ideas of gender stereotypes? It seems like identifying as ?outside the binary? just enforces that you have to behave a certain way simply bc you?re male or female. You can?t be a ken doll with no sexual organs or characteristics, how can you even identify with having ?no gender?? the same people insist that gender is a social construct too! If it?s made up, why are you investing in an imaginary system instead of using simple words to describe physical attributes?

Basic summary: 11 year old girl denied bathroom access and forced to bleed through her clothes. Mother complained. Issue happened again. Mother complained again. Girl finally issued special bathroom pass, though now traumatized to return to school. School gives hogwash statement about how they are for supporting menstruating girls and ending period poverty. This school doesn?t allow bathroom access during lessons except for students issued special bathroom passes ahead of time. 

I say, aside from the female abuse here (are all menstruating girls supposed to apply for a special bathroom pass now?), there?s a bigger issue at hand. No student, male or female, should be told they can?t use the bathroom. Nobody should have to justify their need. It?s no one?s business if you have a period, urinary tract infection, weak bladder, stomach issues, sudden flu symptoms, bowel issues, etc... (I remember being asked in front of the whole class why I needed to go to the bathroom so bad on multiple occasions. Saying ?I need to go to the bathroom? should have been enough. I still hate that school with a passion near two decades later.)

A few comments tried to defend the no bathroom rule during lessons because some students abuse it to wander or vandalize.

If someone wants to forgo their education with truancy, that?s on them. Any student caught breaking rules can be disciplined after. This doesn?t justify treating students like animals and denying them the dignity to take care of their body. Many have stated that holding it in has given them infections and later kidney problems in life. This bathroom restriction rule has caused many to avoid drinking water for 8 hours to avoid needing to pee during school hours.

Health comes first!

So... if you scroll through the comments (I tried linking to the article directly, but rule 8 banned my post), you?ll see how common this is to the point where students have urinated or defecated in the class (not necessarily all recent, but this shows we still have a human rights issue long over due). So many girls have been forced to sit and bleed through their clothes.

One parent in the comment section says, at the beginning of each semester, they meet the teachers and tell them outright what would happen if they denied their kid bathroom access. They have yet to have an issue.

Reading this, I think it?s a good reminder for parents to have the bathroom talk with their kids multiple times starting with when they enter school. (A few in the comment section say they raised hell when their 5 year old and 7 year old were denied the bathroom and peed their pants.) Tell them bathroom access is a human right and to leave anyways if the teacher says no and to refer the teacher to the parent if they take issue with it. It?s better to deal with the teacher afterwards than to have an issue right there in class or cause health complications. Emphasize this. The teacher can try justifying themselves in front of a human rights court if they decide to fight this.

Edit:  also, a few comments tried to justify the rule because having people leave to go to the bathroom during class would disrupt the lesson. I call bullshit on this. Nobody leaving the class has ever disturbed me. The only time class was disturbed was when the teacher specifically stopped the lesson to make a deal out of it, questioning why they didn?t go earlier.

Edit 2: teachers, perhaps you have a defence when the higher ups try to push you to enforce this rule. Freedom of conscience. Or something similar. I can?t think of any decent person thinking this is okay. 

Edit 3: I think the solution for kids needing to go to the bathroom without having to verbally ask is either developing a hand signal and the teacher nods at them or gives a hand signal back. Or there could be a sign out sheet by the door. They could initial beside their name when they return. So in case of emergency, the teacher has a list of names of students absent from the class. This could actually work better. It?s a written record of who left the classroom.",0,1554996048.0,bc14ko,148,GenderCritical

Steven Avery?s ex fianc? said he was sexually coercive, demanding sex whenever he wanted and referring to her as ?my vagina?. If you don?t know, Steven Avery is the subject of ?Making A Murderer? on Netflix. Basically, he went to prison for the murder of one woman. Years later, his conviction was overturned, but two years after that, he went back to prison for murdering ANOTHER woman. The series basically tries to prove him innocent beyond a reasonable doubt, and then to posit that he?s not evil, but the emotional trauma inflicted upon him by the justice system just FORCED him to become a murderer. 

And look, I know the US justice system is thoroughly awful. But by the time the documentary was made, he had already been convicted of the second murder. They act like it?s just a coincidence that two women he knew turned up dead. But because America hates nothing more than holding men accountable for their own actions, people bought it. Now, we?ve learned that he was abusive to yet another girlfriend, and people STILL somehow believe that he?s innocent of the first murder, and that he should get out of prison because he was unfairly forced into committing the second murder. This guy deliberately and violently murdered a human woman. Women?s lives just hold zero value in America. 

And I mean, even the ones that don?t try to prove the man innocent, like The Bundy Tapes and Abducted In Plain Sight mine horrific violence against innocent women for entertainment and profit. It?s not just objectifying, but it desensitizes us to that kind of violence. Suddenly, murdering and raping women is the type of thing we?re comfortable talking and thinking about on a daily basis and just for fun/entertainment. 

And why is every show a story about the male perpetrator? They always use evidence and stories from the man?s life. Why did Serial spend so much longer talking about Adnan?s friends and family than Hae?s? Why does the Ted Bundy show tell us how and why he murdered the women, instead of telling us about the events in the women?s lives that led them to be in that situation. 

I mean, seriously, in America, we idolize violent men. They murder women, and we reward them with fame and attention. And it leaves them a legacy.  People will remember about these men long after their deaths, but nobody knows anything about the victim?s lives, or even their names for the most part. It?s just... so deeply wrong.

This man heavily pinned down his girlfriend and choked her during sex to the point she had dark, ugly bruises all over her neck and upper body. Her housemates saw her afterwards, and rightfully were terrified her partner was abusing her. But haha, how stupid, it was only sex!



The man announced everything was fine. All that had to happen is the girlfriend explained to the entire building that she WANTS to be physically abused, because it's sexy. Then everything was okay.


So many comments are saying the housemates should've ""minded their own business,"" or even to have assumed firsthand the injuries were from sex. And of course, there's misogyny thrown at the housemates for them ""just wanting something to be upset about"" and supposedly only defending this woman for virtue signalling. Comments are actively insulting and discouraging anyone assuming domestic abuse from... obvious signs of physical abuse.

I want to make it clear I'm just a normal woman (meaning I'm nothing special. I just take care of my house and my neighborhood and sometimes get involved in my town stuff. I don't really get into much out of that.) I'm not someone who gets into politics ever. I'm not going to know or understand a lot of terms or abbreviations to write on this post (I saw other posts with terms I have really no idea what they mean). Sorry if this annoys some people. I'm very religious but I respect others decisions, as it's not me to judge, even if I wouldn't do so for myself. Also, English is my second language. Again sorry if my English or grammar isn't all that great. 

I was abused as a young child multiple times. Emotionally, physically, and sexually. So preventing women abuse and making sure there is places for women and their children is a very important issue for me. A good friend of mine decided she wanted to start a women's group where women who were experiencing emotional issues because of abuse could come and talk to other women that have experienced the same thing. A place where women could feel safe. I thought this was a great idea and helped her with setting up a lot of stuff and even helped buy some stuff for the group sessions that were held twice a month. 

For the first couple of months it was pretty great. A decent amount of women showed up. We discussed anxiety, depression, signs of abuse, abandonment issues, attachment issues etc. A lot of women came and discussed what they were going through and we helped them a lot. One women who was in an abusive relationship, while we didn't talk her into leaving her husband, we did get them to both go to relationship counseling. I still talk with her, and he is actually no longer abusing her because of the counseling and us encouraging her to at least talk to him about how all of this makes her feel, especially with them having two children. I know some people might not think this is the best outcome and would have wanted her to leave him, but that was the best we could encourage her to do. She was very no on leaving. 

After the second month though, I think word got around about our group. At first we thought this was great, until a few men who were trans decided to join our group sessions. It was very clear they were trans, and they openly admitted it as well. We decided to let them stay because we thought it wouldn't cause too many issues, and after talking to most women in our group they didn't see too much of a problem with it. We all figured we could keep it about women. What ended up was the opposite of what we thought would happen. They started to complain about very small things. For example we had these papers we printed off each week for the women in our groups to read and take home. They were about how to spot red flags of abuse, they had suicide numbers, they had numbers to women abuse centers. A lot of times we gave out journals with them as well. One week we had papers on how to check for breast cancer and how important it is to get check ups as women. It had numbers and addresses to women doctors offices that would even help them pay for these things if they couldn't afford it. After passing these out and talking about them for a few, one of the trans spoke up and told us we should have added things for people like him. We were confused and basically asked him ""what?"". He spent the next twenty minutes explaining (our groups were only about two hours, one hour spent on talking about what we were passing out and doing a group project, the next hour letting each women talk about their issues if they needed help or advice on anything) why this wasn't ""trans friendly"" that we should provide numbers that help trans people. For example sex change counselors etc. We basically said this is a women's group and that is why we are only adding things for women. He said he was a women and these are women issues. We didn't really say anything after that, we were a bit uncomfortable to be honest. The rest of the group session went on, and we could all tell he was annoyed but we didn't really know what to say. He actually left the paper there and didn't take it with him. 

Then the next week after that during the talking part of our group him and his friend decided they wanted to talk about their problems. We learnt really quickly that their problems weren't actual problems at all and that time would have been better used to let any of the other women talk. They both just talked about how they were constantly discriminated against and how last week us not listening to them about adding trans support on our papers was proof of that. They then talked about how adding certain things would make them feel more welcome etc. We listened but I mean honestly no one had anything really to say. The women were a bit uncomfortable, and me and the main person who set this whole thing up were a bit annoyed because it felt selfish to us. We should have just kicked them out and told them not to come back then but we didn't. 

After this they started emailing me and the main women a lot. We always had our emails at the bottom of all of the pages in case any of the women wanted to email us at any time. They started emailing us that they felt left out. They started emailing us pages to print out about trans or LGBT papers to give to the group. We basically emailed them back and told them that we were not going to do this as this was a women's group and not a trans group. We did tell them we would print out anything for women who were lesbian, bi-sexual, or trans themselves. This wasn't enough because they specifically wanted us to print and give out things that were for trans women. They started to email us and complain about food we had bought for these groups. We didn't really think they actually had any real issues with any of this but were just trying to complain because we wouldn't be more accepting of trans people. 

The last straw was one week we had a police officer come in and talk to the women. He was specifically a police officer that dealt with abuse cases. He was one of the men who would go in, help the women, and take them to the women abuse centers or get them help etc. He explained what exactly happened, and he had brought in a women police officer as well who would deal with talking to the women or helping with things women would only want other women to help them with. Basically when situations got called in they would have one women police officer that would talk to the women, help her with whatever etc, and then two big male police officers that would escort the women to the police station and then the women abuse centers so they felt safe. He explained the whole process, and the woman explained how the women abuse centers were (not in great detail because of security reasons at the women abuse centers but a general idea). The reason the women explained this is because no men, including male police officers were allowed in the abuse centers unless there is a call of an issue happening inside. Since these places have high security there has literally never been an issue since the opening of these abuse centers in my area where they have had to go in. 

After they were done talking people had questions. Well of course the trans had questions. He asked specifically about what trans people are supposed to do if they are in abusive situations. The police officer said that they could call in and they would get them help. The trans then asked ""Yeah, but where do we go after?"" The police officer explained that we didn't have abuse centers in this area for men or trans. That they would most likely have to find a place outside of the town we lived in. The reason for this is because there just wasn't many cases of men or trans calling in about abusive situations in this area. In fact while they had worked in this town they had zero calls for men or trans. The trans then went on a rant about why he couldn't just go to the women abuse centers. The police officers were confused as was every other women in the place. To cut this short, he ranted got angry, complained and finally we asked them to chill out and we would discuss this later. At the end of the group session we asked the two trans to stay so we could speak with them. We told them we just couldn't do this anymore. That they weren't welcome here anymore, as this was a women's group and not a trans group but we felt they were making it about themselves. They called us so many names, even though we felt we were being really polite them. Transphobic was mentioned at least a dozen times, and while they were leaving the one trans called us ""dumb bitches"". 

After that we thought this situation was over with. That we could go back to a normal women's group with barely any issues. Nope. They started calling the people who ran the place we had our group sessions in. It was a free public place basically because we simply couldn't afford some place that cost money. They told them that they can't force us to let them in our group but the place was public so we couldn't actually kick them out either. So they started showing up during our group sessions but sitting away from us. At first they did nothing but stay there, and to be honest it was really fucking uncomfortable. But whatever we were like they can sit over there as long as they aren't bothering us. Soon after they apparently started up an LGBT group and would have people come in the same day and time we were having our group sessions. They would talk over us, use up the minimum space we had where we laid out things. They would talk over women who were speaking which would make the women feel bad. One time they were speaking extremely loud about how bigoted people shouldn't be allowed to speak anywhere. The groups just became really uncomfortable and a lot of women stopped showing up. Some women even emailed us explaining why they didn't want to show up anymore, and yeah it was because of the two trans men and the new LGBT group. Eventually the woman (my friend) who started the whole thing didn't want to continue doing it anymore, and we ended the groups. She was really upset about it and crying to me about how she just wanted to help women who had gone through the same thing as her and she felt this was unfair. That she wasn't bigoted but just wanted to have a women's group.

That was my first time ever being around any trans person. I was so upset over this and found it to be completely selfish and unacceptable. I have one other time where a trans person has caused a lot of issues for me (not that long after this btw) and I will post it later as it's more personal and I wanted to just post this first. Plus this is already really long. I'm just still so angry over this because it was actually helping women but men who think they are women because they wear lipstick and girl clothes think they have to be the center of attention, even in a group that is NOTHING about them. I'm glad I found this place because I honestly haven't got a chance to rant about this and most places I would probably be banned for posting this.
