1500,1,"#Rule 1 and Truscum

Recently, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of discriminatory comments and posts on this subreddit regarding trans people who do not experience dysphoria - also known as ""truscum"" rhetoric. Proponents often call their stance ""transmedicalism,"" i.e. the belief that being trans is a medical condition (and, necessarily as a consequence, those without such a diagnosis are not actually trans).

This is unacceptable. We do not allow this.

It wasn't written into the rules before because it was considered redundant, but discrimination based on the presence or absence of dysphoria *is in fact a form of discrimination,* and patently against Rule 1. You will be banned for this behavior. We condemn truscum rhetoric in strong terms.

Q&A:

*Isn't this discrimination against us? We're allowed to have an opinion!*

No. Rejecting ideas which directly damage members of our community is not a form of discrimination. You can change your ideological stances any time you want. Non-dysphoric trans people cannot change their identities any more than any of us can.

*The definition of bigotry...*

...is [the following:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot)  
> Definition of bigot  
>   
> A person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices.  
>   
> **Especially** : one who regards or treats the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.

Having particular ideas does not make you part of a group. Your ideas can change, quite easily if you allow them to, and opinions do not constitute an intrinsic identity. A trans person without dysphoria cannot change that fact and your unfounded prejudice against those individuals is not something we find acceptable.

*I can't believe this subreddit has gotten so political/IDpol/snowflakey/SJW/etc, I thought this was a meme sub*

Cry some more. Discrimination has always been against the rules, and that doesn't suddenly become a bad thing just because you're the one with the harmful take.

*Mods are gay >:\^(*

Yeah

#Sexually explicit memes/Thirstposting

There has also been a recent surge in NSFW/sex related posts in this sub. Historically, these posts use to be considered okay, and there wasn't a rule against them. There is nothing inherently wrong with being in touch with your sexuality. But the recent posts have brought up an issue: the presence of minors on this subreddit, and the existence of a dedicated 18+ NSFW sub (r/traaNSFW). Aside from bordering on illegal in some countries, the interaction between minors and much older adults in the comments of many of these posts tends to get very creepy very fast. Therefore, we have decided to disallow overly sexually charged content on this subreddit, and that encourage all such content go to r/traaNSFW instead since that community explicitly excludes minors.

Q&A

*Are you trying to sexually repress young people? I'm 17 and have nowhere to post my trans sex memes.*

No. But we are trying to curb some deeply troubling behavior we have seen recently, and prevent vulnerable young people from being taken advantage of by people who would harm them. This is an issue where we must act in favor of safety. We recognize that sometimes young people do sexual things before their 18th birthdays, but we cannot allow minors to interact sexually with adults and vice versa in our community.

**Edit 3/25:** It's been two weeks. A lot of questions have been asked and answered in this thread. And every single top-level comment has pinged my inbox directly. I'm locking the thread for now and directing all further questions to modmail, so that other mods have a chance to reply if I'm asleep or don't have the energy. ***Read all the replies in this thread before sending us modmail to avoid sending questions we've already answered. Do not send modmail just to argue.***",0,1551763206,axhdkx,1424,traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns
1501,1,"It's a slur. It hasn't been reclaimed. You should NOT call trans people, particularly trans women, traps, **unless they say that they identify with it.** Because yes, some people do identify with it. And that's OK!

&#x200B;

But for much of our community, it's a term that perpetuates harmful stereotypes - that trans women are 'tricking' men into sleeping with them (this is also linked with homophobia and toxic masculinity). Indeed, there is a legal defense in most US states known as the 'trans panic defense', allowing those who attack trans women to get a lesser sentence, because they were so surprised that somebody was trans, they murdered them. And whilst these cases may not use the word 'trap' explicitly, it's the exact same thought process behind it - that transfeminine people are men who wish to trick other men into sleeping with them for some reason.

&#x200B;

I think we can all see why many view this word as highly problematic, and do not identify with it. So please stop arguing that it's OK, that it's not transphobic, that 'it's just an anime joke bro stop being so triggered'. Do not dismiss the experiences of people in our community who have been hurt by this, and do not try to argue that it is harmless. Comments arguing this ***will*** be removed. For more clarification, please see rule 1, and rule 6.

[Recommended viewing for more information. The video discusses how the word is used in anime (the community from which it originated), and how trans people aren't 'traps'. (PedanticRomantic's video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxeB2AXIG3E)

[Optional viewing, it's pretty funny but not suitable to everyone's tastes. It goes into detail regarding the culture that uses the slur and its origins. (Contra's video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg)

[Here](https://lgbtbar.org/programs/advocacy/gay-trans-panic-defense/) is an explanation from an LGBT law organization regarding the panic defence, or the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense) page has a a long list of gay and trans panic defences being used.

2007,0,"Hi, I'm new here, but you all seem lovely and I'm having a hard time. I'm a 29yo who's always identified as cis male. This year, though, something clicked, and I've _really_ starting questioning my physical expression, especially around clothing.

The catalyst was literally a tweet I read that said (paraphrasing) ""if you're cis, and you feel constrained by the choices made available to you in terms of what you wear, how you present yourself, you owe it to all the much more vulnerable people out there who are bravely doing their thing in a much more dangerous position than you to get out there and break norms"".

I thought to myself, ""actually, I really fucking do. I hate the 'uniform' I feel I'm allowed to wear as a man, and especially as a man working on tech"". So I got dresses. I got skirts. My wife showed me how to paint my nails. I got otherwise masculine-coded tops and jeans and shoes but in floral patterns or feminine colours.

And then, I shared pictures of myself online wearing those things. On my twitter, to people who I work with, or know irl, etc etc. I got _so much_ support and compliments and just an outpouring of love. It felt right, I feel like I look right wearing those things. I feel like if I put on my old dark jeans and bland hoodie and didn't look after my hair etc, I'd be hiding myself now.

This is all about appearance so far. But it's made me question a ton about my gender too. And this is where I'm just _lost_. I find it pretty problematic that gender questions have come with clothing questions, to start with: part of why I'm wearing what I am is that I don't _want_ clothing choices to be constrained by gender (or anything else really).

But come along they have all the same: does this mean I might be trans? Does it make me something else? Nonbinary? Gender fluid? Does it need to make me anything? A prevailing thing I see is people saying ""does it make you feel uncomfortable to be referred to as 'he'?"" etc. My answer is: not really? But I also wouldn't mind being called anything else: she, they, whatever. It's just not something I have a strong attachment to at all. I don't know if that means there's nothing to question or if it makes me something very specific.

TLDR: Sorry for the volumes, but that's where I am. Super happy wearing whatever the hell I please at home, anxious (but working on being less so) to do a lot of it outside, and wondering what it all means for me.

Edit: seeing selfies here is inspiring and I want to post my own but feel for some reason like I don't belong, because I'm not convinced I'm anything other than a cis guy who likes wearing dresses...

2011,0,"I was lucky enough to be raised by hippies, who didn't force any binary gender roles on me as I grew up. I knew that after puberty I'd have to wear shirts on hot days when outside the community, so I spent every minute I could riding my bike and playing topless as a kid.    
    
Inevitably, puberty came. I wore sports bras and men's clothes. When my parents were asked about their kids, they said they had 4 boys, because I'd told them I was a boy. I was still just allowed to be me.   
   
It was in college, ironically, when surrounded by hippies again, that I had my first gender ID crisis. I realized all the things I'd gone through growing up (wanting to be a man when I grew up, identifying as a boy as a kid) was what trans men experienced. When I moved into an apartment with 5 girls I realized I really didn't understand them. They had a meeting about decoration themes! What? That's a thing? Was I trans?    
   
I decided that probably yes, but I didn't want to make any changes to my body (partly because I know how hard life would be as a 5' tall trans man, and partially for religious reasons), so I just changed my name. I continued to just be me. As I said, my friends were all hippies, so when it came time to swim, we all wore the same thing: nothing. I was comfortable.    
    
I had a (comparatively) brief swing over on the feminine side from about age 25-35. It was the only time period in my life where I felt comfortable wearing a dress (now, like before, it feels like I'm in drag).    
    
But I swung back to masc hard. I also recently moved.   
   
I've been struggling recently, because when it gets hot, I want to take my shirt off. But I either have to go inside and close all my blinds, or wear a sports bra, which gets gross and sweaty when it's hot.    
   
Then there is swimming. I feel uncomfortable if I'm not wearing swim trunks at least boxer-brief length. I was pairing that with a 1-piece, but it was too much fabric, and when I went to dry out in the sun, I my belly couldn't get any sun (which is the best part). Also, I've lost weight, so every piece of swimwear I have is too large.   
    
I'm hoping to find swimwear I feel comfortable in this weekend. I want small swim trunks (not too hard to find), and a top like a sports bra. Bikini tops are all about maximizing cleavage, which is not what I want. I tried swimming in a black sports bra, and it felt good, but it wouldn't stay on while I swam.    
    
Can anyone give me suggestions as to where I can find swimwear I'm comfortable in? I want feel as close to being like I'm just a dude in swim trunks, but without upsetting the others at the pool by having my breasts out.   
   
Are there sports bras that would stay on while swimming, and dry well? Are there women's swim tops that are about coverage, and not cleavage?    
        
Also, is there any kind of binder/bra/etc that could wear on hot days to feel comfortable without breaking any nudity laws?",0,1556306611,bhqbx3,1,genderqueer

At first I thought that I was a girl and honestly it was kinda fun socializing as one and wearing clothes associated with that specific gender role, however I still feel conflicted about myself back then and I still do now. I switched back to he/him pronouns and I honestly find it pretty euphoric sometimes, however what remained unchanged is that I still want to transition to have a female body although I wouldn't get SRS and I'm still quite feminine despite the pronouns changes and I still preferred feminine clothes over masculine one. But then I got sick of he/him and switched back to she/her and the cycle repeats.

2016,0,"Just sort of saying hi and biting the bullet. I am 100% certain that I am graygender. I am also 80% sure that this was fed by living in semi-constant dissociation, but I don't care because unless I suddenly develop a sense of gender I am still graygender whatever the cause is. I basically spent my life assuming gender was just something you took on based on your genitals and was shocked to find out that people have feelings related to their genders.

Then I was kind of angry that I had never been told it was not ""normal"" to literally not give a shit about what your body looks like. Had some surgeries that affected my hormones and fertility cause tumours, and apparently it isn't ""normal"" to just tell the doctors to cut it all out and not care about fertility, appearance, or anything. Preservation and reconstruction are important to some people (which I respect), but not to me. So then I found out that graygender is a thing and I feel kind of happy to know that I'm not just ""not normal"".

I have had my own struggles with gender identity over the last year, namely because I don't relate to gender at all and realizing this has been an experience. Life was easier when I just went along with my assigned gender without ever questioning it. Realizing that I would have gone along with ANY gender is kind of a trip.

&#x200B;

So if anyone else out there feels unsure what their gender is, or if their feelings are valid, or if it is OK to be AFAB and femme, or AMAB and masc, and still feel nonbinary: it's all fine. You're valid. Seriously. You don't just have to go along with what you were assigned because it's easy. I wasted way too much time doing that.

As some background, I'm physically female though throughout my life I've questioned my gender identity a lot. I think I'd say that overall, I'm just pretty apathetic towards my own gender, so I don't mind people seeing me as female, or male, or anything else, I'm just chilling. However, I've always felt uncomfortable with really blatantly feminine styles - I hate wearing dresses and only ever wear makeup when I have to for theatre - because that's just too much for me and makes me feel really alien in my own body. So, I already dress fairly androgynously, just because I'm happier that way, but I'm looking into maybe getting a binder for the days when I just really can't be bothered with femininity and/or feel less comfortable presenting as a woman. The only problem is that I have really long hair - like, down to my thighs kind of deal -  which I absolutely adore but I'm not sure how I could style that in a way that didn't make people immediately see me as female.

I often wonder? are there actually a much larger % of people who are trans, or non-binary / binary nonconforming, gender-fluid, or something similar - but the social construct is so prevalent and those maintaining it work SO HARD to convince everyone they must be one or the other, that a lot of these people just kind of never think twice? 

They are comfortable enough, they?ve been assigned certain pronouns all their life so it?s just familiar at this point and if really pressed they?d be fine with any pronouns anyway, so it isn?t enough to really get them thinking or wondering more about it and digging deeper into their own gender and identity.

But it feels... not fake, but I?m worried it?s not valid. That I?m misinterpreting my own privileges for possible gender fruity... (i.e. the reason it doesn?t bother me if someone calls me ?she? - I?m always going to be protected by patriarchy as a man who mostly fits the binary expectation). Other times I really do feel disconnected from one gender, especially a binary gender ID. 

There have been times where I?ve seriously wondered if I am trans but I?ve avoided it all my life until now because of all that binary sex/gender essentialist conditioning and it was never even a possibility I knew to consider until now, and now it feels way too late to transition anyway ?

And then other times I?m like, no I?m a man ?Yes I wear all my clothes from the ?men?s? section because it?s familiar and comfortable, but outside a handful of things, I really I don?t have a lot interest in or identity connection to most ?traditional? expressions of manhood or masculinity.

And then I realize... all that is made up and has nothing to do with gender or identity either and I could act like the most stereotypically masculine male man to ever Be A Man ?? and still be non binary or trans or anything!

I'm afab and genderqueer/nonbinary.  I'm very unhappy right now because no matter what I do I get read as female. Even on days that I try my hardest to seem androgynous (no bright colors, wearing a binder, no jewelry of any kind) I still get read as female, and it makes me feel terrible, especially because I like doing some ""traditionally feminine"" things, like wearing earrings and sometimes even dresses and makeup, but I know I can't do that anymore of I'll be read as female for sure.   I wish I could wear my binder more, but it makes me feel cold and clammy, and like I said, it doesn't even make a difference in how people react to me.  Even in the queer community on campus (I'm a student) I often get read as female, and one of my nonbianary acquaintances has misgendered me multiple times, even though they know my gender and pronouns and I wear a pronoun pin.  It's like I'm not even nonbinary enough for other nonbinary people to recognize me.  I'm often afraid to go to places like the Pride center because I'm worried people will accuse me of faking, and I'm afraid to correct my professors on my pronouns because I tried doing so (politely) in the fall and as a result the normally friendly professor avoided speaking to me for the rest of the fall and the winter term.

I think I'm interested in looking into a small does of testosterone, but I'm so afraid that I won't like the changes it will cause.  I've made a list in my head of the changes I want and those I don't, but I know there's really no way to control what happens if I start taking it.  And while I want to appear more visibly not female, I'm also afraid to do so because of how trans people are treated.  I'm part of a fairly traditional martial arts school, and have been for five years, and I don't want to lose my place there because of medically transitioning.  The martial arts school feels like a second family to me.  I want to talk to a doctor on campus to get solid facts and advice about low dose testosterone, but I'm worried that because I'm so unsure I'll just be wasting their time, and when I tried to find out who to see and when to set up an appointment the doctor I was talking to started asking questions like ""did you know you were nonbinary when you were a small child?"" and when I told them I might have been, if I had known there was an option other than being a girl when I was that age, but didn't know it was, they seemed very judgmental.  I'm trying to look up information online, to learn more before I try to talk to a doctor again, but I keep panicking because I hear some people say that the changes from non binary transition are never permanent, so I feel like I'll never be seen as how I am, and I see other people who are so happy with how they look, and they look amazing, and I know I'll never be like them.",0,1554837605,bbc3eh,15,genderqueer

I may seem new here, but over the last few years ive jumped from r/crossdressing to r/lgbt, to so many other related subreddits trying to figure out who I am. And in the last few months, I've figured it out, at least for the most part. (yay?). As I think I relate most closely with gender-non conforming, I've noticed something that bothers me more and more.

I am AMAB, 24, gender nonconforming, and *straight*.

*wait.. you're straight and gender nonconforming?yes.oh.*While I am probably blowing this out of proportions, i guess i need reassurance that people like me exist. That's it. I think some recent thinking and recent events has kind of put me at a boiling point. It's driving me nuts. Like even today, after my bookstore job, I see a book that catches my eye, and its ""Sissy: A Coming to Gender Story"" by Jacob Tobia. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe not. I give it a quick glance and i realize its all about gender conformity--and I'm thinking *yes! finally a book that relates to me!well.....kind of.*Im about 100 pages in, and yes, i should (and will) read the whole thing, but I've found out that the author is gay, and gender nonconforming. **And there's no problem with that.** I'm just a little frustrated because he doesn't really talk about experiences about trans and straight people, like me, and probably other people, and after i realize that, it just gets more frustrating. And don't get me wrong, theres lots of stuff I can relate to, and I enjoy his little stories so far, but it wasn't what i expected and It disappointed me. it just doesn't relate to me, because like many before me, I've been assumed gay by family, friends, strangers for expressing myself femininely. And I don't know if i'll ever be taken seriously by cis, straight women, or really, anyone... I was even nearly sexually harassed last year on a trip outside the country, and that scared me.

TLDR kind of:So again, ***i guess what I'm asking is one, that if you gender-nonconforming, straight AMAB friends could come out and just say HI, so I know im not alone***, and maybe even give me a piece of advice on what to do about being assumed gay, or how to do dating, or hell, just life in general.

I don't usually think about it much but every now and then, maybe every few months or so, I get so frustratingly aware of the fact that I don't have a dick, and that there's currently no surgery/hormone option that would really accomplish what I want. I don't hate my vagina, it just isn't really of use to me. I don't want to bear children, I'm almost never interested in being penetrated, etc. I tried using an STP a while back and I'm just too scared of like, ending up making a mess out of my clothes in a public bathroom, so I just gave up on that.

As long as I can remember I've just been interested in getting off in the closest ways I can comparable to if I had a dick, all the way back to when I first learned what masturbation was. The second person I dated (I dated men before I realized I'm nb lesbian) got me a dildo, and I was so much more interested in pretending it was attached to me than using it for its intended purpose. But, I suggested to him once ""what if I had a dick?"" and the answer was ""no"", it didn't come up again for a long time. For the next few years, I never really took it seriously. I only really get noticeably dysphoric once in a while, and it's only lasted a few days or so, so I never really had a reason to take it seriously. This time I don't want to just ignore it, but I just don't even know what to make of these feelings.

The area I live in is pretty conservative and isn't very pro-LGBTQ--I don't think anyone here would hate you if you were gay, but they're definitely less understanding of less well-known identities (like being genderqueer).

(I'm sure y'all know how it is. *Genderqueer* is harder to explain to most people than just *trans guy or gal,* and sometimes the idea of having to explain myself makes me doubt my identity a little.)

Anyway, partly thanks to my current hairstyle, no one really sees me as a transmaculine/genderqueer dude. (Obviously, I'm trying to change that with a new haircut.) I should also add that, because of the whole transmasculine thing, I'm aiming to be read as male and not female. In fact, it's gotten to the point where I wonder if maybe I'm just a guy, period--but that's another story, so I won't go into that here. Point being, I'm genderqueer and looking to present as male/masculine.

So, I found this LGBTQ-friendly salon, *and* I found out that they have online booking--which is a double score, because I hate talking to people on the phone. When I was booking an appointment, though, the site asked me to sign up for either a women's haircut or a men's haircut. I knew that effort-wise my hair qualified as a women's haircut, but in terms of style, I wanted to make sure I got a guy's haircut. Also, I know that for trans people, getting haircuts can be a harrowing (hairowing?) experience, and I wanted to avoid any distress caused by someone trying to give me an androgynous women's cut or something.

Of course, I realized I could just suck it up: sign up for the women's cut, and when I get there, insist with all my might that I'm transmasculine, hoping that they haven't already decided my gender before I even walk through the door. But then I thought, hey! Why don't I email them first and ask?

Yeah, great idea.

(No, really, this was actually a great idea. Just...not-so-great execution.)

Again, my area--really, my state in general--is more conservative, so I was wary of saying that I was genderqueer. I didn't know if they'd understand what that meant, or if they'd associate it with something negative and write me off. And honestly, I'm still having trouble asserting my gender identity; rather than speak up and gently correct someone when they misgender me, I tend to just get pissed and say nothing. But for this haircut, this first step toward really presenting properly, I wanted to own my truth.

...own my truth in a way that did not *explicitly* say I was genderqueer, just in case that would hurt my chances of getting a haircut.

So I ended up writing something like, ""I'd like to get a men's haircut, but my legal gender is female, although I don't identify that way, etc., etc., how should I book the appointment?"" I read over the email, reworded it a few times, proofread it, and sent it to my sibling for a second set of eyes. Everything looked good. This was the perfect email! Satisfied, I sent it off, then spent the next six hours anxiously waiting for a response.

Around dinnertime, I got a very friendly email confirming that yes, because my hair would take longer to work with, I should technically sign up for a women's haircut. However, there was a spot where I could leave a note specifying that I identify as--as--

*Oh, no. What have I done?*

Ah, yes, friends. My first time owning my truth, but I...didn't quite own it. See, apparently the phrasing I used--where I said I wasn't female, but didn't specify what I actually *was*\--led them to believe that I was a trans guy. The last part of their email (about how I could attach a note to my appointment) was telling me to leave a note so that the salon knew I identify as male.

Now, maybe this isn't as simultaneously amusing/horrifying to y'all as it was to me, but oh, was my face red when I read that email. I never considered the possibility that they would automatically assume I was FTM--though in hindsight, what *else* would they assume? Like, man, I really walked into that one. 

So then, of course, I was tasked with the incredibly awkward process of emailing the salon again to try to explain that *no, I'm not technically male...well, yes, I'm definitely more male than female. Actually, have you heard of being genderqueer? Because if you have, then this is really awkward, because I could've just mentioned this to begin with. Uh, actually, I just think I'll try the next salon on the list.*

Okay, so I didn't write that, exactly. However, I did feel really embarrassed and stupid writing that clarification email. I mean, maybe they don't even care how I identify. Maybe that was TMI. And they were so nice and understanding that I hated to ""correct"" them, especially with something that makes a lot less sense than just *trans guy.* 

Then again, if I didn't email them back, I was worried there would be some confusion if the ""guy"" who just emailed them then turned around and booked an appointment as *gender: other.* So, I sucked it up and sent them the awkward email.

Of course, part of me is laughing at all of this, because this is exactly the sort of thing I would do. It wouldn't be the first time I've put my foot in my mouth and given someone the wrong idea about me. On the other hand, now my impostor syndrome is through the roof. I keep thinking that maybe I'm faking being under the trans umbrella, or that I'm wrong and confused, or that I don't deserve to assert myself as transmasculine or genderqueer, et cetera, et cetera.

That's all wrong, of course. I know I'm valid. Lurking on this sub (and texting my sibling 100 times in the past three hours) has taught me that much. Still, this was...not the start I wanted for my first men's haircut, lmao.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this story with y'all because I thought it was funny in a slightly horrible way. Of all the things I imagined going wrong when I tried to book a haircut, this didn't even cross my mind. But I mean, hey, at least I'll be getting my men's haircut. 

And let this be an inspirational message to you all that there *are* accommodating salons out there...even if you accidentally request the wrong kind of accommodations.

I'm AFAB and have been gender-questioning (closeted) for over a year now. Since last year I've started presenting more masculine, and for a good sixish months it was definitely at the forefront of my mind to the point where my friend told me I was acting strange -- and then I sort of filed it away and decided that I should stop worrying about labeling myself for now and just enjoy being me. 

Lately I've been starting to get more and more annoyed when people call me by a gendered term like ma'am or miss or young lady. Or when people get excited that they never see me in a dress before because I never wear them. I feel like I'm only treated as wanted or valuable when I'm dressed as a 'lady'. 

I've also been a little bit frustrated with how I want to present myself vs. how I actually present -- I don't think I hate my body but I definitely get frustrated that I don't look as androgynous or as masc as I want to (broader shoulders, more muscular, more square jaw, etc).

I guess what's been stopping me from coming out as gender-questioning is that I'm wondering if it's body dysmorphia I'm feeling and not dysphoria. And I'm wondering if I don't like female-gendered terms because that's just not my thing or whether I don't like it because of how society treats women/female/femme-identifying people. I feel like and I want to be more than the gender that people perceive me as, but doesn't everybody want that?

I was assigned male at birth and have spent the entirety of my life up until a year ago leaving that state of things completely unquestioned. I can?t say that I was ever much of an overtly masculine child, never really feeling all that strong a personal attachment to the concept of masculinity as a whole. This isn?t to say that i wasn?t socialized to behave in masculine ways and express aversions to feminine things; I just don?t recall ever perceiving masculinity and the expectations that surround it as anything important or fundamental to my identity. Traditionally feminine things like girlish tv programs and woman?s clothing definitely appealed to me just as much as the ?boy stuff? that I had been socialized to accept (I fondly recall partaking in the apparently rather common activity of dressing up in my mother?s clothes whenever I got to be home alone). Dressing in women?s clothes (or, at least, things like towels and sheets that I would fashion into skirts, bras, and dresses) was, now that I look back at it, a pretty big guilty pleasure of mine as a kid (and it still is to a decent extent). I lived with, and at the time ideologically formed a part of, a very devoutly conservative and religious family, which might partially explain why I never felt as though any of this merited any further introspection.

You look desperately for people like you, for anyone who can tell you that it?s ok, that you are normal and valid. And when you find them you dare only look. And what you see is only differences. And you feel fake.

Even as you start to tell others the shame remains. Even when those you tell accept you there are people you will never tell. Because how can they possibly understand? How can they possibly accept something you haven?t? How can anything ever be the same?

And you think that you will always be alone, even though you have friends. Because who could ever love a person who doesn?t love themselves. And the doubt, it isolates you. And the doubt, it consumes you.

The weirdest part of the brain injury is the memory lapse I have. From October to May of last year, I have a ton of memory loss. I understand that I didn?t really go out in the time period because of social anxiety. Since May, my body dysmorphia has gone through the roof. I have no idea what I want to look like and find myself completely unattractive. Even old photos of myself that I thought were hot then are ugly to me now. I?ve started wearing slouchy suits when I teach, and I still feel like I?m perceived as femme by my students, even though they know my pronouns and my name. 

It?s gotten even weirder because I?ve been so isolated. I don?t talk to any of my old friends, and without social media, I don?t see or hear from my friends in other cities/places I lived before I moved.

I feel like I?ve gained weight but can?t actually tell if my body is that different or if I just have zero self-confidence. I also can?t even picture what an ?ideal? version of myself would look like. I also struggle feeling attracted to other people now, but have started being able to sleep with people again.

I feel like even admitting how insecure I am makes me a bad feminist, and problematic, and is grounds for some kind of callout in my old circles. But it?s so bad and I hate myself so much, and I feel so ugly. But I also feel like I need to fix it, because I do want to date people and enjoy sex again and go out and have a social life. I think I would be happier and more confident in grad school, and feel less disassociated from my past.",0,1551561965,awml1a,12,genderqueer
2213,0,"I've seen some comments on this sub and some other forums expressing this sentiment of wanting/preferring to be their partner's boyfriend rather than a girlfriend (or the other way round). Or statements like ""in relationships, I'm more like a man (or woman)"". 

Initially, I thought perhaps this comes from a place of reluctance towards extreme sexist gender stereotypes. As in, I'd rather be someone's girlfriend than a boyfriend because this way I'll be seen as more empathetic/tender/whatever girls are stereotypically seen as and not as an unfeeling asshole.

But I still don't really know what people mean by that. I mean, if this was about actually transitioning to another gender, I wouldn't be confused, but it seems to be more focused on the social role or something. And I tend to get quite confused when people talk about social roles in general.

For example, one person (trans guy, for all I know) on another forum wrote that he wants to protect more than he wants to be protected in a relationship, and that that's somehow a male way of thinking. But is it? I mean, is it really more common for men to have this mindset? Or another person, a friend of mine (cis guy, for all I know) who I once pointlessly argued with about whether there are any significant psychological differences between men and women: he claimed that one of the distinctive traits men tend to have is being responsible in relationships. Heey what? So what are women in relationships, irresponsible?

Does anyone else consider themselves in this way? Are you ?a nonbinary woman? or ?man?, or are you just ?nonbinary??

I?ve been fighting myself on my gender identity for a while now. I?m a GNC bi woman and the first time I tried to come out as NB/GQ I wound up freaking myself out and taking it back because I suddenly felt like I was losing myself. I read and wrote about gender politics and feminist theory in college and feel like being female is an inextricable part of myself and my experience. When I came out as NB I felt like I was wiping that away, and it gave me the feeling like I was floating out of my body and I no longer knew myself...when coming out was supposed to make me feel MORE like myself.

I?ve tried to make peace with being cis female, but that doesn?t sit quite right. It?s like a jigsaw piece that looks like it should fit but belongs to a totally different part of the image. So you mash it into place and it KINDA works, but the shade of blue for that patch of sky is just slightly off and you had to force the edges and now it?s gotten a crease in it.

?Just? female isn?t quite right but ?genderqueer? is a step too far in the other direction. I don?t want/need my gender to be a huge deal. If I can present masculinely that?s all I need to be comfortable. I?d like smaller boobs or to bind so that I look more andro in public, but I don?t want neutral pronouns. She/her simply feels like home, even if I?d take a neutral passport marker in a heartbeat and cringe at the thought of ever being in a position of employment that would require people calling me ?Miss?/?Mrs?. I have few to no things that ?need? to change and it makes me wonder if I?m not off-center enough for it to be worth labelling myself. But more than that I want to understand my gender.

I freaking love men. I thought I was bi for a while--I think deep down there are some parts of me that monosexuality can't explain--but at the moment I prefer the company of men. 

What really gets me is that I see men that I am undoubtedly attracted to, but at the same time would like to embody. Somehow, though, that makes the attraction all the stronger. 

Like, *the way he walks, how he holds himself, it's so masculine. I want to walk like that--and God he looks so good doing it.* 

Or, *The muscles in those arms. I want arms like that. But for now, I need him to put them around me and not let go.*

But what I think is interesting is that more masculine doesn't mean more attractive to me. In fact, I find myself  liking men who are rather shorter and stouter. That softer look, whether physically or in their characteristics. What that means, to me, is that I'm attracted to the same masculinity I strive for.

Something that I often fantasize about is my beau crying on my shoulder. But for me, that doesn't come at the expense of never being able to cry on his shoulder. I guess I want a relationship featuring expressive, emotional masculinity on the part of both of us.

On OkC I have the setting turned on to not see or be seen by straight people. In that time, I've made several new friends and saw one trans woman who would hook up with me but then tell me she didn't want to date me, who eventually ghosted me, and another cool trans woman who is unfortunately for me in an open relationship and not looking for anything serious. People that I'm most interested in largely don't message me back or ghost and I have a huge log of conversations that just petered out.

Now I know the concept of gendered clothing itself sucks, but bear with me. My school farewell is a few days away, and I have to wear 'traditional' clothes, it being a formal occasion. My mom is very excited and has picked out a sari for me (this is India) and booked a hair styling and make up session. And I just... sigh and wish I could wear a suit like the guys.

I've gotten out of wearing 'girly' clothes so far by wearing jeans and T-shirts outside, and the school uniform on previous school events. But on the farewell, all the girls are expected to wear saris and glam up. The rest of my female friends no doubt look forward to it. The only topic of discussion among them right now is what they're gonna wear that day, where they bought their outfit from, and so on. Not me.

Thinking of that day makes me die a little on the inside. My dread of that day is like a constant buzzing pain in my head. I feel like I have to tell *someone* now, else I'll choke on my own emotions, which is what drove me to write this post. I am not looking forward to it, the unsolicited comments like  ""Oh, you look so pretty"", no doubt said with good intention, but entirely lost upon me. I stopped looking at mirrors long ago, cause I DON'T relate to the person I see there. I hope I don't cry when I see the final result of my makeover. 

But in a way though, I am curious to see how I react to my being dolled up that day. Will my dysphoria go poof, and never return, and I will live as a cis-woman happily ever after? Or will it confirm something I already knew, but never admitted to myself? Will it finally push me to stop pretending to be someone who I am not, and motivate me to fight for who I really am?

Talking about my gender has always been kind of an awkward subject for me because I guess I was never sure anyone would take me seriously. I don't totally agree with gender roles or labels, because the definitions of what is masculine and what is feminine always seemed arbitrary to me. And yet, I looked at what was considered ""masculine"", and concluded that even though there were some things I like about myself that I would consider such, by and large I don't really identify with it. I emotionally relate more closely with women, and on the inside I feel soft, sensitive, and feminine. Now that I've started digging into some of those feelings, I've realized I am much more comfortable expressing myself that way. Really though, I would rather just be able to express myself as whatever the hell I feel like. I'm told that's called gender-fluidity, which I have sometimes identified with in certain spaces, but I still formally identify as a male because it's easier to understand than whatever the hell I am.

I was towards the end of my high school career when I got to really understanding myself and my gender in this way. It was about the same time I started to experiment with wearing women's clothing. I've been doing it for long enough now that I have a small repository of women's clothing that I would either wear in my privacy or in the company of my best friend, who herself has gone a long way in helping me explore myself, helping me pick out clothes and letting me paint my toenails. When I dress up, I'll stay dressed up for a while, and then regret having to change back into my regular wear because it doesn't feel as comfortable. I don't dress up for very long or very often, partially because I'm usually not alone for long enough to dress up in my own space, and I only get to see my friend once every few months. The other reason is that it feels taboo, like I'm not supposed to be doing this because I'm physically a man and I wouldn't go out like this normally. I have taken measures to try and quash this feeling, including going to sleep in my women's clothes or posting pictures of myself in women's clothes on social media. It all seems in vain.

In terms of my physical appearance, I already have an established personal style; sort of an emo crossed with grunge look that I'm mostly content with. I would describe this appearance as masculine. And yet at the same time, I have this vision of myself as a lady that I'm obsessed with, and I've spent nights dreaming about it. It makes me feel insecure about my body, being that I have a very large upper build, facial hair and body hair that I neglect to shave at regular intervals, large hands and feet, and a noticeable belly (I'm not exactly the spitting image of health). It makes me feel like I could never achieve the feminine appearance I desire. I will look at images of other women and feel envious of their appearances. I struggled with basic self-care for a very long time because I felt so terribly about my body. I've seriously considered hormone replacement therapy. I don't consider any of these feelings to be actual dysphoria because I don't think I'm trans, though I could be wrong. Either way, I very much want to see myself as a woman in the same way I've seen myself as a man.

Truth be told, my growth was stunted for a long time because I never saw myself as ""good enough"" to challenge accepted definitions. I'm twenty years old now, and I only came out to my parents about all of the things about a month ago. I did so in hopes that I wouldn't have to feel ashamed of myself anymore. And now I'm actively working with my therapist to help me explore my feminine side. The more I dig into it, the more I feel like I could actually be transgender. And though maybe I'm expecting change to happen faster than it actually will, I'm still struggling to make it happen, and I would like to know what I can do to achieve congruence with my gender. I've been told that it's remarkable that I have such a deep understanding of myself given my age, but I could never really be sure if what I'm feeling is real. Whatever I am, I would like to rest assured that these feelings are valid and not something I've manufactured. I swear I'm not trying to run away from myself, I'm just trying to be myself.

I?m AMAB, he/him, 32 years old (a little late to be looking into this, I know), but I?ve never really identified strongly as male. I?m fine with it, I guess, but I don?t really fit the stereotypical mold. I?m a total beta male - shy, introverted, self-deprecating, empathetic, and without any of the cockiness, aggression, or toxic masculinity you see in many guys.

I guess I feel towards my own sex like the Neutrals from Futurama - ?I have no strong feelings one way or the other?

If I had to go back and pick from the binary choices, I?d probably pick male again, but not because of identity, more for perks like male privilege, better treatment in my occupation (computer programming), and actually having pockets in my clothes.

I?m fine with male secondary characteristics. I have no desire to take on a more gender neutral appearance, even in private. I lift weights and have a fairly fit body that I?m happy with.

In terms of orientation, I?m mostly straight, maybe 1.5 on the Kinsey scale. Low sex drive, often submissive, and I like cuddles as much as sex. Porn is a turn off when there isn?t an emotional connection - a ton of porn is downright abusive, but that?s a topic for another time.

It had grown to become so constant that I thought my gender dysphoria was no longer an issue and I was female with only a few sporadic days of body dysphoria. I was very wrong. I just finished highschool last year and it happened to be a very rough one. One thing I noticed during the time that I have since moved to nearby NYC to work for a gap year is that I feel much more relaxed and comfortable yet my gender dsyphoria has spiked to intense and very confusing levels. I am constantly questioning gender. 

I have a very female appearance to the point that even when I shaved my head and never wore makeup I was still never thought of as male besides by the very old and blind librarians who immediately corrected themselves after hearing my voice. I have never been very happy with being so feminine even when I felt female for long periods of time. But at the same time I have days when I am completely fine with my appearance and even wear wigs so I can have different hairstyles. I love my wigs and I am hoping to get more that have more masculine looks as well but for the most part they are very long and dyed in fun colors. 

This causes confusion for many people especially ones that I have recently met because I have whole new social groups now that I have moved. I don't often let people know that I am genderfluid because I don't feel comfortable presenting myself as such while I am so distinctly feminine. And so far I have only one person who asked me what pronouns I prefer(they/them, he/him, she/her in that order). Afterwards she saw me in a wig and with makeup nearly the next day because I was feeling female, which later switched to male later in the night and caused some intense self hate. But anyways she paused for a little bit when she saw me and I admit 
that it was probably confusing when following that very short conversation that didn't give nearly enough time to explain anything. But it still reminded me of the other times people who know that I am genderfluid see me so distinctly female when I am usually fairly not. And it has caused me to have a lot of reservations with wearing wigs especially because they seem to be accepted fairly easily as a woman but as someone who identifies as genderfluid and still looks begrudgingly looks like a tomboy female it is confusing.

I am considering retiring the wigs until I gain enough money to go on T so I can at least seem a little more masculine or even primarily masc, and then wearing wigs when I feel comfortable with having less chances of being misidentified but it's all a very iffy matter at the moment and is just very confusing for me.

The pastor spoke about Christ suffering, sprinkling in some messages about how ""god ordains an identity for you"" and ""gay marriage is bad"" and how we should be obedient to ""those who rule over us"" (some divine right of kings bullshit) etc., I told my parents as we left that I disliked the message but loved the music (the music was more traditional, with a live orchestra and an impressive organ, which was nice). They told me they liked the message. When I told them I disliked the anti-gay stuff my mom told me that ""you know I believe in the bible, and that the bible says being gay is a sin"".  She also told me that she was ""probably wrong in this"" but she believed in gay marriage, because ""most of them are going to divorce anyway, but at least they can keep the kids"" (I have no idea what she meant by this, the argument she usually uses to defend her position to family goes something like ""If they're going to sin by being gay, at least they won't be promiscuous in marriage.""). She said that no matter how much she feels sympathy for them, they're still wrong. She said she can have her feelings but in the end she knows that it's wrong. She has a right to hold these opinions but I just want to share this, because she is the only person I have to rely on. She is the most accepting person I know. The end of the day is where it got really terrible though. I asked my aunt, who has previously said that she accepted my identity, what she thought of my nails. She said ""You're a boy, you shouldn't be painting your nails"". I responded ""No, I'm non-binary."" She said ""Yeah, but... come on."" she rolled her eyes and then patted my head saying ""You are a boy"". My mom responded by saying ""This is just his college expression"" (She is the only person I know who will defend me. Even if her defenses still hurt they hurt less than the attacks of those around me. So we're very close.) I said ""No, this isn't just a phase, I'm non-binary."" To which my aunt responded ""Didn't you hear the message?"" (referring to the church service \[I'm an atheist too but she doesn't know that\]). ""At least say you like them."" my mom said. ""No, I'm not going to complement a \*boys\* nails."" Then my mom tried to defuse the situation by talking about things my aunt shouldn't have done when she was in college but I won't tell them here because even if she's ok with publicly embarrassing me I'm not ok with doing that. The conversation ended with her saying ""I was just saying my opinion."" To which I responded ""Yeah, well your opinions sucks.""

There were other terrible experiences too. For instance, I try to look androgynous but no one ever thinks I'm a girl. Everyone thinks I'm a guy. I don't know if I'm failing. I don't know if I look ugly. Here's a picture of my face, I'm not wearing makeup because I felt it would bring too much attention to me. Do I look super masculine or something?

2286,0,"So I'm afab. But a lot of things have led me to start questioning my gender. And I'm just confused and I don't know if I'm just a super masculine/butch cis girl, or agender, or a demigirl, or genderfluid, or what. I'm also autistic and I know dysphoria     

I guess my first instances with gender were when I was super young, like 3-4 years old. At preschool, during recess, they would often play boy vs girl games. And half the time I'd go to the boy's side (I think at one point I'd even made a schedule -- Mondays and Wednesdays were boy days, and Fridays were girl days lol).    

My parents were, I'm guessing starting that age up until I was about 13, very against ""girly"" things. They said anything ""girly"" was stupid -- makeup, fashion, dolls, etc. (when I turned 13 or so, they started expecting me to be more girly, but i never did)    

Despite this, during elementary school, a lot of my friends were girls. And I remember being fairly interested in dolls and even somewhat in makeup during that time.     

Then I guess things started to change? I'm not very sure on the specifics.    

When my mother first said I needed to wear a bra, I cried. At the time I think it was because I didn't want to grow up. But ever since then (I'm 19 now), I've layered up on top to avoid having to wear one, and to avoid people seeing that I have them. They're not even that big lol they're tiny af. Even in the hottest days of summer, I wear a big sweatshirt. I just want them gone. I don't even like saying the words lol. Anything tight I just won't wear. Last semester I had to wear a dress for something that was pretty tight, so I bought some training bras and now I wear those every time I can't wear a baggy sweatshirt. They're so tight but they work. It's still not enough tho... I had my arms in some pretty weird positions to try to cover the chest stuff lol.      

I've always hated dresses and skirts. They feel so wrong. But I'm autistic and have sensory issues, and any pants other than sweatpants are torture, so I've just learned to suffer being super uncomfortable while wearing skirts and dresses.      

I've also recently (and I think before a little, but I gained some weight so it wasn't as obvious) had problems with my thighs and hips and butt. Theyr'e just huge lol. I hate them. (I have a lot of problems eating too, because I just want to make myself as little like a girl as possible).         

I've always been more masculine, and I don't really care about gender roles. In fact, I kinda take pride in smashing them lol. I like being ""that girl who smashes gender roles and acts like a dude"".       

I cut my hair super short about a year ago after years of wanting it short, and it felt soooo much better. And now, people assume I'm a boy (usually a super young one, but whatever). I kinda like that too tho? I like when people misgender me lol. But thne I also like people seeing me as a girl.     

Being called a ""woman"" or ""lady"" also makes me cringe so hard. I hate it.          

At first I thought it was just me having a complex about growing up. But I don't think it is (or at least, not all). I wish I had a more masculine body. i see pictures of cis men wearing suits and clotehs and everything, and I want to look like that. But I'm not trans. I don't have any lower dysphoria, and I definitely want to be as hairless as possible so I would freak out if I got any more hair lol.      

Idk. This is all super confusing. It's like... I want people to see me as a girl. But I want to have a sexless body and I want to get misgendered.    

What could this be?? I thought maybe demigirl, but a lot fo the definitions say that it doesnt include dysphoria, and I have some kind of dysphoria I think. At least upper dysphoria.

My best friend and I aren't officially dating or anything, but we're both openly interested in each other and pretty romantically and sexually involved. For anonymity, let's call him Jeff.

So, Jeff here has always considered himself straight. He's definitely attracted to women, but funnily enough, never dated one. He's dated two afab nonbinary people though, one transmasc though not ftm, and one was more femme. Additionally, I'm afab and agender. He's never dated a trans woman but he wouldn't rule it out, and he finds some of them attractive, given that he's into women. He's not into trans men or cis men. Not sure on his stance on amab enbys, though he made a passing comment of ""they're cute"" about one I dated if that counts for anything.

He's honestly quite the ally. Incredibly spportive of his LGBT+ pals, and I have no doubts when he says that he he sees trans men as men, trans women as women, and nonbinary people as, well, nonbinary, that he's 100% sincere.

Now here's what the post is about again of course. He isn't pan, he doesn't feel like identifying as bi fits him, but he doesn't feel right claiming to be straight either given his attraction to and relationships with nonbinary people. He's not a chaser or anything either. He considered himself heteroflexible for awhile, but dropped that because he thought no one would take him seriously. I've assured him he doesn't need to label himself and that his feelings are perfectly valid, but he says he'd be far more comfortable with ""knowing what he is"".

When I was around 11 I started to ?steal? my sisters new bra or underwear when they got home from shopping and my mom always assumed that they left it at the store on accident. I would try them on but then quickly felt like I was doing something terrible and threw them away. 

When I moved out on my own I started to explore things but only panties and sports bras, I just assumed it was a fetish of sorts. After that I started looking at clothing online but I was alway too scared to actually order them online.  I still don?t understand why it was easy for me to buy a hot pink sports bra at the self checkout but I couldn?t bring myself to order online. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago when I heard my sister explaining genderfluidity to someone and it just clicked in my brain. I came out to her and one of my other sisters who I knew would support me a couple weeks later. Not long after that I started to actually order clothing off sites (mostly underwear and lingerie that I could wear under my boy clothing and no one would notice) and at that point I thought I?d figured it out and I was good.

Not even close, over the past year I?ve started getting more and more clothing and I?m starting to wear less men?s clothing. I?m still closeted other than maybe 6 people so I still present male in public and even around those I?m out with because I worry about how I look. But I don?t remember the last time I wore men?s jeans, I wear jeggings exclusively now but I alter how they come across by having them rest on my waist for a feminine look or my hips for a looser masculine look. I don?t wear men?s underwear unless there?s a chance someone might see it. I wear leggings under my pants any time I can?t wear my jeans. For the past couple months I?ve mostly been wearing women?s shirts with a hoodie thrown over it. I?m kind of worried about what I?ll do when it starts to get warmer and I can?t hide things so easily. However every now and then I do feel super masculine and wear men?s clothing(I still wear the jeggings though because they?re fucking comfortable and men?s jeans are terrible). 

I don?t think I?m trans because while there are times I wish I had a vagina and could openly present that way, I also really like my penis and I know I?d eventually regret my decision. I?m starting to feel some major dysphoria about it all.

When writing about this, it feels stupid, because I know that gender is a construct and whatnot, but I also don't really feel like a member of the lgbq community because, even though I identify as queer, I don't really know enough queer people to say that I feel like I belong. I often feel like I would very much like to be a woman. I'm attracted to women, but the idea of being a woman and being with a woman as a woman (if that makes sense) is incredible. I don't really know how to explain this intense desire I have. I'm sorry this is so rambly, but I've never really tried to write about it or talk about it at length before.

I guess I'm curious as to how I can look more androgynous, and how to feel comfortable doing it. I live in NYC, so no one but me really gives a shit what I look like, but I still have this pervasive sense of what's probably homophobia whenever I want to do something outside of my comfort zone. I paint nails now, which is nice, and I hate when they're unpainted, and I want to get more into makeup. My partner is super supportive and encourages me to wear her clothes and things like that, but my silhouette ends up being so clearly masculine that I hate it. No curves!

Can anyone relate to what I'm saying? I feel like I'm not queer enough, as though it's something that has to be earned. Almost like I'm not allowed to be trans, although I believe pretty firmly I'm not. I think, ideally, I'd want to switch between man and woman at will, but obviously that's not possible. I don't know. I'm confused and I want to figure it out and feel comfortable in my expression and feel like myself.

* society's expectation of ""manly man"" is dumb. only idiot blindly follows it unexamined. you know what, society also want to you be to a workhorse, work hard and pay tax until you die, are you gonna follow that expectation? there are a lot of wrong messages in life from different people you got to filter it with your reasoning and some faith.
* you don't need to be on E to be a girly ""girl"" and a ""Mom"". if you run a business like a company, build products, or make arts such as music, the business or company, the products, the songs/art are your babies. they are yours. you will spend years or decades to take care of them until they grow up and are able to take care of themselves. you are still their mom by then. you are the business girl, music/art girl, or gamer girl.

* you can also be mom to your biological babies. cook for them, make sure they are eating healthy, talk, listen, spend time with them. genetically you will be more motherly and patient to your children than all the other dudes and girls.
* defines your own success, femininity and masculinity. if you found your love, won people's respect, made good money, shower your kids with love and guidance, have a healthy body, you are a fucking success. your girlfriend is gonna love you. she's gonna so be happy that her SO is also her BFF. there's not many male in the crowds that has the natural ability to be BFF with girls.",0,1549267825,amzm8o,0,genderqueer

Everyone still wants to use he/him or (much more often) she/her and I'm realizing I feel like I can't correct them anymore. With she/her it was different; I pretty much knew people would take me seriously and get the idea when I said it, but that certainty evaporated when I came back as something less neat and conforming. Most people just won't get it, I know how cis (and many trans) people talk about us, and even when they're supportive they don't think about it the same way as they do with binary trans people.

I can't correct them because now its superficial. I'm not a ""woman trapped in a man's body"" anymore; I'm something less serious and important even to the people who I know will go along with my pronouns. I can read it way too clearly on their faces, and that might honestly be more painful than them getting it wrong. 

The real reason I don't correct people though is because if I start doing it I'm also starting a timer until I hit a snag. I'll always be waiting on the other shoe to drop, because it *will*, (and probably quickly) when I finally hit someone who'll make it a big deal, someone unafraid of announcing that they just don't get it and challenging me. In that moment I'm not going to have the wherewithall to be an educator, and that'll cause a lot more pain than the sum total of misgendering.

I feel fine calling myself a ""woman"" but I don't necessarily feel like only a woman or like the ""woman"" I am expected to be. Wearing skirts or dresses makes me want to crawl out of my skin. It makes me so uncomfortable, just thinking about it makes me feel physically disgusted. The last time I put on a dress was for my sister's wedding and before then, the last time was over 7 years ago. I also hate knowing/thinking about that I have a uterus, and sometimes I think I would prefer having a penis and I daydream about having a penis during sex. I don't hate having a vagina and labia  (it's really the uterus that disgusts me--I used to feel uncomfortable with a vagina), but some days I would prefer a penis. Pregnancy all around also disgusts me and even thinking about ever being pregnant makes my skin crawl.

Up until age 13, I hated being called a girl and being associated with anything ""girly."" But I also hated being called a boy.

2328,0,"Before I start, I want to clarify a few things about why I am making this post.

Talking about indifference, apathy, pomogender etc. at length might be uncharted territory for a lot of communities. People talking about this are few and far between (considering the few people who do find it worth their time to talk about it). Some definitions of apathy describe it very similar to gender non-conformity but I think there are enough differences with the mindset and behavior to differentiate it.

I thought it would be helpful to add my two cents to the understanding of indifference. I'm not be best case study; I'm in early stages of defining what I am and others may have drastically differing experiences later in their journey. Also my platonic behavior might be tied to asexual traits but I think there are enough differing traits to make a distinction.

I am not making the claim that indifferents are a suppressed individuals; based on my lifestyle, indifference is probably inconsequential in my society. Also, I'm not trying to claim that pronouns are unimportant; pronouns/roles are very important, they ascribe internal/external qualities, have a social function and they make English the convoluted lovable trashy language that it is.

With that out of the way, I hope you find that my perspective gives some more light on the topic. I would love to hear differing opinions and experiences regarding this (if you are willing).

Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm 24 years old.

Not too long ago, I publicly told the void that  ""I'm indifferent to my gender"". What I wrote took me aback. I had to ask myself, am I actually questioning my gender or am I just at odds with how society expects archetypal male traits from me?

I'm born male. I look like a male, I walk and talk like a male and that's okay... I guess... I don't feel the urge to change my appearance to more butch or fem. I always lived comfortably in this body so I might keep it this way. I don't mind people deliberately misgendering me, in some scenarios it can be endearing. I look after kids a lot of the time so ""aunty"" or ""koka"" (Te Reo for aunty) is appropriate sometimes. If you wanna be endearing and call me gal, girlfriend, dude, guy, bro or sis, that's cool. If an ass tries to call me miss, maam mistress mrs, or lady, I'm not entirely phased. For my use, titles and pronouns have either a sentimental or utilitarian function. Apart from the descriptive use I don't demand titles cause they are like tools to me; not for socio-political reasons, just that my birth-sex doesn't play a part in how I interact or exchange in my community. I can fit comfortably in a lot of groups; whether be a circle of aunties, a bunch of farming blokes, sisters getting together for a reality TV marathon, it hasn't much consequence, there is no lynch mob from me gardening or taking up pottery instead of hunting.

Now this is where I talk about some of my asexual traits. I may not be giving a complete picture of what indifference is; but I should probably mention it.

I never really felt the desire to explore my sexuality with other people. Some people might brush me off as a virgin (that's okay, I'm fine with that) but when I picture desire or attraction with others, I can only see platonic romantic interactions with people. I have a drive, I have visual cues for attraction but it's not how I actually desire for relationships.

In summary, what do I feel like?

I am biologically and chemically male but being male ranges from being fine to meaningless to me. My personality comes from something deeper in my soul, something that flows through all forms of me.

I am into androgynous people for sure, but I sometimes am into guys or girls. When I feel like a boy, I would be gay, attracted to people of the same gender, because it'd feel natural to me, and this happens when I feel like a girl, I would be lesbian. However, in this fluidity, when I am in the ""in-between"" those two areas, I'd stop seeing people are gendered beings, just agendered persons, and in parallel, I'd wonder if I'm ace or grey. I identify primarily as ""fluid androgynous"", a term I just made up, because so far it describes myself best. Anyways, that being said, if I come to feel sexual attraction in my androgynous nonbinary moments, it'd be to androgynous people.

2336,0,"So it's late. I just laid down to sleep after comforting a sick friend/roommate with a cuddle and a temple massage. And it struck me that as an AMAB, this would be contextualized differently than if I'd been born female. And I got to thinking about a lot of things that for me is just friendship that others would see as something else.


As a guy, this would be something reserved for a romantic interest. A lot of affectionate displays and comforting others would be. Even something like hugging is viewed that way. Like my nephew. He's 8 now and doesn't like goodbye hugs anymore. But my two nieces I couldn't leave without at least three. 


Being gender queer makes how I express affection and how it is perceived awkward at times. I'm never quite sure what the protocol is. People who are more accepting don't have as big of a problem with things like hugs or kisses on the head. But I've seen it cuts both ways. AFABs who prefer handshakes also seem uncomfortable when hugged at times. It's a barrier whichever side of queer someone is on.


I try not to let it get to me. The other day I went to a Leann Chin and a girl there was new and was flustered. As a customer I asked if she wanted a hug. She almost burst into tears and said ""YES!"" and we hugged and gave our names. That's not something two guys would do. But it felt natural to me.


That's the thing about gender though. Sometimes it's hard to tell where identity ends and personality begins. Am I just a touchy feely person or is it because that's what's expected, or is it forced unconsciously. I don't have good answers. But to me, handshake or hug was
a bigger question than what bathroom to use. At work, guessing wrong could be seen as sexual harassment. But doing neither comes off as aloof or cold. 


It also struck me how we interact with friends can be so
different. Two girls can kiss goodbye and nobody thinks twice. Or netflix and curling up on each other. Two guys and they have to be gay. Or sit on opposite sides of the couch. But what about non binary people? It might seem like they're picking a ""side"". And it's common to hear people comment like ""well, if he wants to be a guy, he shouldn't do that."" What if they're just more affectionate? What if it's a personal choice of personality instead of social identity? Shouldn't that be validated too? Does it have to mean more?


There's no guide on where the boundaries are. Often times it feels like I'm just blundering around in ambiguity.  Can I cuddle a sick friend? Should I offer? How would it come off? These are questions I ask often, things that for other people it would be obvious. And it can be jarring to do what feels natural to me but the other person gets awkward about.


But as awkward as it can sometimes be, choosing to be affectionate instead of safely remaining distant is a choice I'll keep making. I don't know if it makes me more of a woman, less of a man, or just is who I am. I just know that it's a colder, harder world to always pick the safe choice. To remain gender neutral in a world that does its best every day to make me choose a side is a hard fight. And sometimes I don't give a damn what side I'm on.


I just want to feel alive. To be a part of the world, even if it doesn't have a place for me. To participate in the story of life, in all its delicious ambiguity... To me, is worth, any price. Life is too short to wait until I've answered all the questions. Sometimes I just have to jump, and hope I'll find the answer on the way. But I'd be a liar if I told you I knew what I was doing.

I would say that the way we label gender just doesn't work with me--I don't feel female or male or anything. Sure, I use female bathrooms and I check ""female"" on forms, but I'm most comfortable when I don't have to answer the question. To put it simply, I am and am not a girl in the same way that I am and am not a boy.

I fear it will become more difficultif they look less female toblend into my traditional place in society with them as my partner witch raises a whole host of stuggles/questions. Many of witch nonbinary people experience regularly and by dating this person I also adopt some of.This all makes me question if I actually like them for who they are or if I'm just lying to myself.Even though Its fairly straight forward for me to call my partner by the correct pronouns and respect there gender identitythis whole thing will become ""more real"" after they take steps to transform there body.


Also my mother past away from Breast cancer a few years ago. She had surgery and i witnessed her struggle with the opposite kind of disphoria afterthat. I am worried that seeing my partners chest in the future might be a traumatic reminder of my past. *Deffinetly a mood killer during sex.


I really care about them and want to be with them but I also don't want to enter into a relationship that maybe I will think differently about in the future. I feel really horriblethatthis is even a question for me. If you love someoneyou love them but there are always compromises.

2362,0,"Hey yall
sorry for the whining and the throwaway account but I've been in a not so good place recently.
Just a lot of venting

Like the title says, I genuinely hate being nonbinary and all the assumptions that come with it.

My identity is not a political statement.

I'm not proud of my indentity (though I support people who are) and have no desire to ""shove it in people's faces"" as the transphobes like to say. I just don't have the luxury of being stealth, and therefore, will ALWAYS have to choose between severe dysphoria or being out.

I have atypical and likely incurable dysphoria. It can probably be lessened, but not eliminated. It's my burden to carry for my whole life. I have a right to bitch about it.

I don't demand special treatment like cis people seem to think. I just want equal treatment, and I'm not even provided with that.

Terfs seem to have this idea that all afab transpeople are trans because ""the patriarchy!!!"" and ""misogyny!!!"" but I have an atypical experience here too. I don't suffer from internalized misogyny (mostly because I'm not a woman, but yknow), but I've also somehow never been a victim of misogyny or any type of oppression, discrimination, or harrassment because of my AGAB. Given that I've somehow avoided those factors, why would they be my motive to transition?

A lot of cis people seem to believe that my identity is based solely on stereotypes. It has nothing to do with that at all. I've always been a little more masc leaning. Why couldn't I just be a gender nonconforming girl? Because Im not a girl. God I wish I could be a girl, I really do, but I'm not. 

A lot of binary trans people are under the impression I'm a ""transtrender"" because ""nonbinary people don't have dysphoria and just claim to be trans to fit in""

I have severe social dysphoria

bottom dysphoria

chest dysphoria

voice dysphoria

height dysphoria

I had dysphoria even before puberty.

I came out for the first time around age 6 or 7. Then again around 12. Then 15. Then 18. I was always ignored because ""what if it's a phase?"". No one pressured me to be trans. I desperately wish I could be a cis girl, or at least a trans man so maybe I could have curable dysphoria.

I don't give a damn about challenging gender or enforcing/not enforcing stereotypes.
That's not it at all.

I'm not ""confused"" I'm just agender.

I want to be stealth so bad but it can never happen if I want to be happy.

I just want to be treated like an actual person and understood.
I want to stop being accused of ""faking"".

I'm 23 and AFAB. I've been shedding a lot of internalized heteronormativity these past few years, and in doing so there's been a lot of closeted/buried feelings and issues that have come to light in full force since I've paid more attention to my inner voice(vs the internalized voices from my parents and the rest of the world), if any of that makes sense?

One of the biggest issues was how much I hated my large chest as a kid, and looking at myself in the mirror causes a lot of grief. I developed really early in elementary school and along with being an asexual who was sexualized at a young age, there's just a lot of mess there... A lot of distain for my body. I remember girls wanting to stuff their bras with tissues and all I wanted to do was wrap Saran wrap around my chest. All the shitty comments from my narc mother about my large chest, boys poking and grabbing and laughing, girls saying they wish they had what I have, saying I should be grateful for what I was born with, etc etc... I feel disgusted with my own body and my hatred wants me to chop them off completely. But I still have days where I really like seeing my feminine body in the mirror, I like how I look in some dresses and feeling feminine is just as much a part of me as wanting to chop my boobs off with a guillotine.

Any case, I'm taking a shot and trying binding for the first time to see if that helps minimize the sickness I feel towards my body on days where I'm not comfortable seeing a female figure. My problem is, I'm worried about the largeness of my chest, if binding doesn't work the way I want it to(large boobs being binded still show enough boob to look feminine vs masculine) and if it will harm any tissues at all by binding(last time I measured my size I was 36GG and I'm worried about the large size). Would it be worth it to actually get a substantial reduction instead of binding first? I'm an incredibly sweaty person and also wondering if using Gold Bond while binding would help with any discomfort there.

2370,0,"So since the middle of last year, I have been very confused as to what my actual gender is. I am 23 and AMAB.

To give some story, it started when one of my BFFs told me that most of my mannerisms (the way I acted around them) was mostly feminine. At that point, I was both shocked and (I guess) happy at the same time that my friends perceived me as that. Since then, I first bought colored nail polish as to enjoy wearing nail polish and breaking the stigma that ""guys should not wear nail polish unless it's clear. I bought it both for the appeal and because I had a bad habit of chewing on my nails, so this helped out a lot. Once I got comfortable with wearing nail polish, I soon started buying more colors to try wearing (mostly different shades of blue and white).

Few months later, next thing I know my mind gravitates buying mostly feminine outfits than masculine outfits, mostly because I could never find anything appealing to me that just says ""Wow, this would look pretty on me"". So about August/September of 2018 is when I started buying more feminine outfits. I was still buying masculine outfits for everyday wear, just not as much. Today every time I go clothes shopping, I mostly just go towards the ladies section and shop there first before the mens section.

Back in early November 2018, I went to an Ulta Beauty store and asked one of the hair dressers in the Salon area about possibly giving me a pixie style haircut. After looking at some pictures on Pinterest and seeing the many styles and how interesting they looked, I really wanted to see how well a hair style like those would work on me. They told me that my hair would need to be long enough in order to get the results that I want. Last I spoke to them was 3 weeks ago. So hopefully next week I'll be able to go back in there and ""maybe"" get my hair cut the way I'd like to go for.

Since November of 2018, I have also shaved my legs, chest and arm hair because I feel as though body hair just gets in the way and especially with my body, most of my chest hair was really ""belly"" hair and to me just looking disgusting if you are trying to impress other people. And just in general, I really hated it. While shaving my belly hair, I figured I'd shave my upper chest hair and then shave my legs and arm hair. Shaving my legs (to me) was a blessing because now my legs feel smoother than ever, even if I have to shave them again every once in a while (same goes for the rest). I also shave my face every other day because someone who's feminine does not/should not have facial hair (plus I've just never really liked it).

Last month I bought makeup (lipstick, lip liner, foundation, primer, a facial brush, sponge, mirror, and removal wipes) and a makeup bag to put it all of my makeup and nail polish in. I've also considered moving my feminine clothes out from a box just strictly for them into the rest of my masculine wardrobe so that I can wear some masculine things one day and possibly a feminine outfit the next or vice versa.

I've also consider about possibly going on HRT and transition myself to look more feminine.

I have not yet ""come out"" to my parents, whom I would like for them to be the first ones to hear about it before I really confirm anything else to anyone, whether it be friends, other family members, etc.  


So in short, out of what I have said here, I'd just like to know if my ""assigned gender"" has changed every since I've considered myself a cisgender male. I'd like to believe that I could be either androgynous or a Transfeminine, but I'd like to get some feedback/ideas/input from y'all as to what y'all think my real gender could be. Yes, I do understand that finding out my real gender is something that should be explored by myself, but I have done some research and I figure if I post something like this here, that I could possibly get some answers/advice.

Generally I'm a 32D, but shallow-chested. Right now I have one padless sports bra that I feel minimizes the look of my chest satisfactorily, but that one's not ideal because it puts some pressure on my neck/ shoulders, where I already deal with pain issues because of a car accident.

- Wearing heels after leg day is a very bad idea
- Women live longer than men unless you count the difference in time spent in the bathroom; I did the math. I didn't include time spent waiting in line. 
- Jeans for men are comfy even when meant to be snug.
- Jeans for women have been known to cause temporary paralysis. 
- Women really do have a better sense of smell. It has to be hormones because F2Ms douse themselves with Axe too and are oblivious.
- Men say ""oops!"" and women say ""oop!"" ... and I don't know why this difference exists.
- It can break someone's brain when they can't work out someone's gender. Like, CTRL+ALT+DEL... some people just freeze up.
- Youtube is full of lies. It's always harder than it looks. *Always*.
- Almost nobody thinks they're sexist. 
- Almost everyone thinks they're accepting/tolerant.
- Everyone is wrong about the last two. 
- I broke down for no apparent reason in the cat food aisle awhile back. None of my (female) friends thought this was in any way unusual or noteworthy. As a guy, this would have been a cause for great concern -- now it's Tuesday. I'm the same person. 
- As a guy, when I went to the doctor and said I was in pain, they ordered tests, asked lots of questions, and referred me to numerous experts.
- As a woman, I'm pretty much on my own unless I have a sucking chest wound and am literally spewing blood all over their shoes. 
- Men's sizing is quantifiable and objective. Women's sizing is a fractal shit show.
- Example -- Men: Boxers or briefs. 
- Women: **?**?^t? pv? / m?-(pt)d? = v?ln(m?-m?))+v?ln(m? - 0)
- Men resolve conflict a lot better than women do. Two men can get into a fight, a few punches are exchanged, and they'll head off and have beers after like nothing happened. Two women get in a fight and it's fucking WW3 with both of them shitting in the other's souls. 
- I never used to apologize for getting into the elevator, but now I do. I don't know why. 
- In 2010, everyone was talking about gay rights. In 2015, everyone talked about which bathroom to use. In 2019, it's which pronouns to use. I expect that by 2025 we'll use pronouns in public about as often as 'fuck', marriage will be something only people ""who live in the sticks"" do, and I'm not sure how I feel about any of it.

But thanks to being bi (I suspect), I have passing thoughts of being more than friends with just about everyone (including her) because most of the qualities I like in my friends, I also like in my partners (go figure). It's a running joke -- ""We can't be friends with anyone.. .there are no friends, there is only prey. We are... the bilociraptors. Screeeeee!"" 


Being trans/GQ though adds an extra dimension to it, and along with it the crippling self-doubt and low self-esteem. What do I really have to offer anyone? Could anyone love me? I'm sure you all get the idea. So sometimes it's hard separating my own self-doubt, sexuality, and getting at what I'm ""really"" feeling here. I don't feel strongly sexually attracted to pretty much everyone, or that might point me in a direction. Plot twist: My friend is also bi and GQ, but unlike me has no interest in transitioning, etc. (she is AFAB, I am AMAB). 


I'm just wondering how other people sort through all this, because most of the queer community still has some scripts to go off of, and their communities and social expectations are clearer. Being *gender* queer though adds an extra dimension to sexuality that has always been ill-defined and confusing to me. Specifically, that there's no sharp delineation between them. Gender identity is interwoven into sexuality, and when both are fluid, it makes separating romantic interest from friendship a lot harder. Tie that in with the barrage of other emotions that come up, and it can be almost impossible, for me at least, to tell where the boundaries are, or even what I'm feeling.

I'm also not interested in hormones, so having facial hair and broad shoulders is not in the question for me either.

What's been nagging at me is how to feel attractive when I'm not interested in appearing particularly male or female. I know personality and other things also factor into attraction, but I'd like to feel hot sometimes! And it's not that I dislike how I look--my style affirms my gender quite well. I just feel like I'm not attractive to others because of my androgynous presentation.

But I feel like people tend to think about whether or not they align with their gender assigned at birth in terms of if they experience gender related body dysphoria and/or gender expression/performance that doesn?t ?match?. And I know this is very important to people?s identities so I mean this question just out of my own lack of understanding of gender as a concept and of my own gender. But I feel like since you can be any gender and have any body parts and express yourself in any way gender identity itself has no meaning to me? And like I don?t understand what it means to feel like a woman. I?m afab and I feel like my ?woman? experiences are related to that I have certain body parts and experience the oppression/violence of walking through the world perceived as a woman and I feel that violence contributes to a strong part of my identity. But the person I was talking this through with said that I don?t understand the feeling of not feeling the right gender because I?ve never had to think about it as a supposedly cis person and that I never had a problem with puberty and all that. But then I felt very upset and emotional unexpectedly because that?s not actually true. I was really upset at puberty when I started getting boobs. And I feel like over time I?ve kind of gotten used to them and done emotional work to try to accept/ignore my body. And I think that?s tied to multiple things like violence/body image around food but also to gender.

I've identified as non-binary for five years. I've thought about changing my name a lot, and within online communities where I've felt safe, I've been trying out different names.

I?m AMAB, and while I don?t have a particularly strong reaction to my given name, there?s a common girl?s name I?ve wanted since I was a kid. Though I?ve never told anyone, I?ve long thought of it internally as my name, and when I hear the name spoken, I can?t help but look up or think of it being my own name, and I can?t think of the name, or of someone who has the name, without associating it with myself.

I?m always read as male, and while that?s a little annoying, I?m generally okay with my appearance most of the time.

I'm female assigned at birth; never felt weird being called a ""she"" or a ""girl"" (I'm sure it helped that my parents let me follow my own interests as a child, many of which would probably be considered more ""masculine""). I did freak out when I hit puberty and started growing breasts, though; I felt so uncomfortable about it and about having to start wearing bras, but I just assumed that was normal.

I'm fortunate that I must have a lot of androgens, or something, because as I've continued to grow into adulthood (I'm 28) I've found that I'm a lot more comfortable with how my body has developed. My breasts are small - barely an A cup - so I almost never wear a bra unless I'm working out; then I wear a sports bra which I'm a lot more comfortable with anyway. I can wear a T-shirt and a men's button-down (my preferred look) and my chest is barely noticeable. The proportions of my body are more like a small (5'4"") man than a woman - relatively broad shoulders, long torso, square hips, a subtle but visible Adam's apple (yes, some women do have these). I also have a lot of leg hair and a bit of a happy trail that's been slowly filling in over the last few years.

I wear almost exclusively men's clothing, and I feel happiest and most confident when I have a short men's haircut - a fact I discovered only 6 or 7 months ago when I specifically asked for my hair to be cut in a men's style rather than simply saying I wanted my hair cut short and showing my hairdresser pictures of what I had in mind. Even though all my photo references were men, he had been ""adapting"" them slightly to feminize them which isn't what I wanted. He was totally happy to cut my hair in a men's style when I brought it up, but somehow hadn't realized that was what I had wanted before.

I don't feel like I need to have top surgery or take T to be comfortable in my body, though I do wish I could grow a beard because I LOVE the aesthetic (really, what I want is that stubble look - mmm). I have ample peach fuzz, but it's largely invisible, and the faintest trace of a mustache. For the past few months I've been taking biotin for hair, skin and nail health, and I've noticed just a couple of darker hairs starting to pop up and my sideburn peach fuzz feels thicker recently, too. My lovely, supportive wife got me an electric razor and some beard balm for Christmas, which is awesome because a) some of my peach fuzz is long enough that I can trim it down with the 3mm setting and it feels like gentle stubble, and b) the beard balm seems to enhance that effect, as well as making the hairs just the tiniest bit more prominent. I told her I've started to cultivate an ""invisi-beard."" We also just started taking magnesium glycinate because like many Americans, we are both magnesium deficient. I didn't learn this until after I started taking it, but it also helps with hair health and growth, so I have my fingers crossed that maybe I'll continue to see some small changes.

I don't really mind that I won't grow a full beard because I do also like the way I look without facial hair, but I would like to make my peach fuzz fuller and thicker as much as I can. (It would never be worth it for me to go on T just to get facial hair, particularly because I love my full, thick head of hair and male-pattern baldness is strong in my family.) In private I sometimes like to put on fake facial hair, and this past Halloween I discovered the ""apply fiber mascara to your peach fuzz"" stubble look and I fell in love with the idea that I can ""enhance"" my existing facial hair to create stubble that is actually ""mine"". This was my Halloween look:

But even with all of this, my identity as a woman - or at least, someone with a ""female"" body - is important to me. I've found that as I've become more comfortable with expressing my masculinity and with the idea that, hey, I might want to start presenting to the world at large with mascara-enhanced facial hair sometimes, I've also become more and more certain that I want to continue to use ""she/her"" pronouns. In a sense, I think this is because I feel like a man and a woman, or a ""female who happens to also be male"" -- and with my presentation already skewed heavily masculine, I guess it my pronouns are the space in which I want my femaleness to be acknowledged.

Unlike other transmasculine individuals I have seen speak out, the label ""lesbian"" doesn't feel wrong or weird to me - in fact, I strongly identify with it, which is probably also part of why I still prefer ""she"". My wife has been very supportive of my gender exploration and in fact, says she knew I was non-binary long before I did (which makes sense, given that she's been calling me her ""wifesband"" since our newlywed days). She is bisexual but homo-romantic, so she says that I'm the best of both worlds because she sort of gets both in one person.

Although I prefer ""she"", I don't mind when strangers call me ""he"" or ""sir"" and generally don't correct them. It can be fun to be read as a he! It can also be stressful though, like when every airport employee going through security called me ""sir"" and then on my way to the airport women's room I suddenly thought, ""Shit, so many people are reading me ""male"" today; what if I run into trouble in the restroom?"" (I like both ""she"" and ""he"" more than ""they"", but ""she"" feels more right despite how I want to present myself.)

I suspect that if I do go out into the world with my mascara facial hair, people will either see me as a cis male, or read me as an FTM person who is transitioning. There are of course some women who grow facial hair and choose to let it grow (i.e. Harnaam Kaur), but they generally present feminine enough otherwise that they are still gendered as female.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! I wanted to both put my voice out there as someone who identifies as transmasculine but wants to continue using female pronouns, as well as find out whether anyone else here feels similarly (or is maybe the opposite - transfeminine but wants to use male pronouns). It seems that most transmasculine individuals use ""he"" or ""they"", which has at times made me question whether one of those ""should"" be my preferred pronoun - but of course, no two non-binary / genderqueer individuals are the same and I get to choose my pronouns same as anyone else.",0,1546030476,aae8lr,97,genderqueer

The doctor I went to for testing was awesome and was absolutely convinced I had it cause I present almost all the symptoms except having boobs (but I'm only 30 and that still may change however I look like I'm in my early 20s). Especially the mental ones. So after an initial negative result he went back and did multi site biopsies and ended up finding it hidden in my body.

But all 3 chromosomes are fully formed for the most part except the Y is damaged on both the XXY and XY (however the SR9 gene is intact so I somewhat had puberty...ish...with a second feminizing one in my early 20s where I dropped a lot of weight, my hips widened, and my fat distribution changed). Which has left me in a weird place hormone wise. Estrogen is through the roof...almost triple that of a normal male...testosterone is just at the low end of the normal line. However I'm lucky in the sense I don't have a lot of the negative side effects from it aside from lack of bulk muscle, wide hips, near zero sperm count, and fat distribution favoring my legs,thighs, and ass. It's to the point he kinda joked with me when asking about HRT if I wanted to look like a girl or guy.

I've always been feminine acting. From interests to social responses. That's just how I've always been. I've usually been quite happy with it. Especially now as an adult. It gives me a unique view of the world and I love it.

Then go shopping with me.""

Every relationship I've had has been with a woman, non-binary, or trans individual who was bi, bi-curious, lesbian, or mainly identified as sapphic (only into women). Who all 'found me attractive because I was ""Feminine"" and didn't set off typical masculine alarm bells in their head' (their words...not mine). But this has created problems too as I've been left before cause I ""wasn't manly enough"" and told to ""stop acting like a girl"".

But...the lack of social acceptance has been...weighing hard on me lately. I see posts on reddit in the lgbt subreddits how much people dislike feminine ""guys"" and I see it in real life too. The adjustment period when making new friends is difficult. Cause people have to get used to not treating me socially like a guy.

As I grew up, I started to shop in the boys section at stores. Sure, I still considered myself a girl in elementary school. I still had my long blonde hair, but I was a tomboy. I liked hanging out with the boys in my grade, and while I did have friends who were girl, they were very athletic and disliked things conventionally liked by girls. 

When I made it to middle school, I moved away from the kids I grew up with. I wanted to fit in, and I was going through puberty. I started wearing dresses and skirts. I started playing softball, and to avoid being called slurs like ?dyke?, I wore bows in my hair.  To get along with the girls on my team and my girl friends, I started acting different. I hated myself. I was catty and boy crazy. It felt so wrong, but my friends were the same way. I didn?t want to stand out.

For me I realised that the majority of the time I was ""meh"" towrads gender, I didnt really care, I just felt I had stereotypically male persionality traits and and then a few more stereotypically female personality traits. Depending on occasion I would express one more than the other and the rest of the time just be quite andro.

However I'm coming to realise that whilst at times I like expressing male and others female I am becoming more uncomfortable with being physically male. Its not to do with having dysphoria about sexual organs, but more - I never think I'll look feminine enough, but equally its more than that? I don't really know how to explain.

I thought that because I was amab, that this meant that I had to transition to female.

I would normally wear sweaters and jean, and I was lucky that I passed really well as a cis woman, but that's just it, I don't feel like a woman at all.

I have considered that I might be a butch woman - but the woman part makes this designation not fit either. Is it possible to be dysphoric and trans when it comes to sex (or sexual characteristics about the body) and not about gender? Furthermore, am I transfeminine because of my desire to have a female body, or transmasculine because of my desire to appear masculine? I don't think this is due to internalized homophobia or some sexualized fetishization of female bodies either because I'm definitely asexual and aromantic too.

So I'm essentially AMAB and I would say I'm male, because it's not an identity I want to entirely reject. But at the same time... I've never been able to identify with the term ""man"", I've always socially considered myself to side more with women, like I'm ""one of the girls"", and essentially just wrote it off as me being a feminine gay guy.

However when I started becoming more aware of gender identity I began to think that I don't want to limit my identity to being a guy, stereotypically gay or otherwise. And only AFTER the fact has it started to occur to me that maybe some of these things I've felt, like not feeling confortable being called a man or prefering to be grouped with women, could in fact be part of a gender dysphoria that has gone unnoticed until now.

In addition to that, I've had a talk with a friend who also identifies as genderqueer and we shared our experiences about being uncomfortable with our male anatomy. Now, I'm already very uncomfortable with my body because of my looks in general, so I thought it was just regular body dysphoria over being overweight and what not, but in that moment it kind of clicked that if my average weight friend who also identifies as genderqueer experiences the exact same kind of discomfort, it could very well be part of gender dysphoria. And ever since that realization I've started to notice these things even more.

So essentially my question is, are these valid thoughts or am I reading too much into things? Like yeah me looking for confirmation that I could be genderqueer is already a big clue that I might very well be that, but you know how it is with the constant anxiety. So yeah, any similar experiences here?",0,1545006679,a6un1n,84,genderqueer

Some background on me:

- I?m AFAB and questioning my gender identity at the moment. I feel much more comfortable with femme presentation around my girlfriend (a cis lesbian), partly because she?s wonderfully supportive and partly because being in a queer relationship takes some of the pressure of traditional gender roles away.

- I studied abroad in Jordan last summer (I?m an Arabic/Middle Eastern History Major, so I?ve been trying to spend as much time in the Middle East as possible), and one thing I noticed was that I felt extremely gendered, all the time. Part of this is certainly my bias as an American who?s been told for years that ?Islam oppresses women,? and I?m not proud of that.

I don't wanna talk about that here. Rather, that I mentioned I was trying to 'gay up' my apartment, and suddenly people were coming out of the woodwork to say ""Why do gay people have to..."" whatever.

And this happens whenever something I write on Reddit that references the fact that yes, I'm queer. In real life too; They're mirrors of each other.


It's the same with being gender queer. I've had a lot of people suggest to me I'm just doing it for attention, or to ""make a statement"", and this bothers me. I feel like they're adding a political dimension to it that isn't there. ""Why does she have to mention that she's transgender *all the time*?"" is a common refrain. Even my parents were like ""It's not that I don't love you, it's just I don't know how to *explain* you."" As though I somehow need a special introduction; That without some kind of apology I'm not allowed to be in that space. Why do I need to be introduced as ""And this is [NAME], who is transgender.""

2487,0,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this. I've realized a few months ago that I'm probably gender queer, gender-fluid or nonbinary. I'm 23 and AFAB. I'm somehow worried (I think a lot of people are) of using the concept wrongly or appropriating it unlegitimately. I don't know if the feeling of discomfort that I feel towards femininity can actually be considered dysphoria. People around me are pretty open minded (I hang out around the polyam community a lot), so I can tell them about my questionning but I don't know many people I could talk to who actually relate. 

As a kid I've had some very feminine (barbie dolls and princesses) phases, and some phases where all my friends were boys and I wanted to be ""one of the boys"" really bad. I've always been more of an intellectual type, and way too bad at sports to be a tomboy in the usual sense. I'm also very small. My parents did not really discourage me from playing with either ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" toys even though they took for granted that I would like feminine things. (They did not disapprove me when I would wear boy's clothes that I borrowed from my friends occasionally). My mother works in a male dominated field and generaly has positions that are pretty much second-wave feminism. She used to be a bit transphobic (she understood that people might want to dress/behave like any gender they want but did not understand that people would want to modify their body to match that), but she has become more open minded now.

As a teenager, I had a looooot of internalized sexism. I would say that I was not like ""the other girls"" because girls are superficial or cause too much drama (which, as we know, is simply false). I simultaneously wanted boys to consider me one of their own while at the same time wanting them to be sexually/romantically interested in me, which could only happen if I looked feminine enough. So I dressed and looked relatively feminine. I sometime told myself "" I wish I were a man, but I could not become one with this body because I would be way too small and weak to be a man"".

As a young adult (or would that be ""late teens"" in English? like 17 to 20 yo), I've been in a long term abusive relationship with an extremely misogynistic guy. It was very hard to get over all the sexist ideas he had put in my head. I'm also a philosophy student, and philosophy has this tradition of being very male-centered, and I somehow related with that tradition. 

Then I started being interested in feminism, questioning gender roles and identifiying my own internalized sexism. I also became conscious that I was pansexual. I stopped trying to look interesting/attractive to men, because I grew more confident and was able to tell myself that people I was interested in had to be able to deal with who I am. I cut my hair short, I stopped shaving body hair, I started dressing more comfortable. 

Then I started questioning my gender identity. I feel uncomfortable (and maybe dysphoric) when people adress me too feminine compliments (such as telling me I'm pretty), when male partners (esp if they're straight) compliment my body. I feel most of the time uncomfortable about my breasts (I wear undersized sports bras to hide them) and very thankfull that they are not naturally too big. I feel a lot of height dysphoria. I feel small, weak and I feel that if I were to transition to masculinity, I would never pass. I compare myself to my male partners/friends a lot. When I talk to men (esp a group of men), I'm always very aware of how tall they are compared to me. I mostly wear men's clothes but they're always a bit too big and look ""borrowed"". I like when my girlfriend says I'm handsome or uses masculine pronouns (neutral pronouns are hard to use in French, I do use them but she doesn't know how to, and they definitely are not convenient). I don't think I actually want to be a man. I'm very aware that my socialization as a woman is a big part of who I am and I feel like I can't erase that (and don't really want to). I mostly want to be perceived as androgynous I think. Which is hard because I'm tiny. Some days I look at pictures of trans men and I wish I had a beard and a flat chest and other days I feel comfortable considering myself a queer woman and using she/her pronouns. I'm generally always uncomfortable about doing things that are perceived as girly, and I wonder if that's internalized sexism too (I do like these things on other people though). 

TL;DR (and conclusion): I'm worried that by calling myself genderqueer or gender-fluid, or wanting to use neutral pronouns, I'm just appropriating the struggles of people who struggle more than me, or that it's just a new ""post-feminist"" type of internalized sexism. I also don't know if my use of the word ""dysphoria"" is legitimate.

-In general I?ve found the whole ?sissy? genre to really resonate, though the term itself does not. I am submissive sexually and I guess sissy stuff would be a fetish, but I am unsure of how that squares with my gender identity on a more holistic level.

-I?ve called myself ?bi-flexible,? but I?ve only dated cis women.

-So far the only term that I?ve found that I resonated with was ?two spirit? but then I found out that you can only be that if you?re Native American and I?m not sure if I have any of that in my genes.

-I think I resonated with ?two spirit? because I am a very spiritual person (to provide some labels/terms: mysticism, non-duality) and feel like the complexity of my sexuality and gender expression and identity stems from my inner wholeness and Self which is actually more ?yin? than yang.

-My ideal partner would probably be a more dominant yang energy woman who would appreciate and celebrate me in my more yin/feminine expression and, at times, appearance.

-I can somewhat pass as being both male and female depending on the clothes I wear and how I present.

-Though I?m fairly new to exploring and questioning more about all this, I really relate to everything I?ve seen from Joseph Harwood in terms of expression, energy and appearance.

-I inhabit aspects of both traditional gender stereotypes - e.g. playing sports but being very sensitive and tuned into relationships, being fairly cerebral and intellectual but also heart centered, enjoying video games and art, music etc. These are the things I mean by being androgynous.

After my big change, I started grad school and noticed my interactions with cisgender (especially heterosexual and white) men are suddenly pretty different. I'm a very shy person, so I wait for someone to approach me when I meet people. It has been absolutely no problem meeting women, men of color, or queer men, but I can literally count on a single hand how many white, cisgendered, and heterosexual men have come up to me in the same way (my school is very white and very cis, so there's a LOT of them). 

I'm wondering if anyone else here has experienced something similar? Is there some kind of explanation? So far, all I've come up with is that they have no idea how to approach me because they don't know what ""gender script"" to follow.

It feels almost like I don't exist - I'm not even standing there, even when their friend who is a woman is speaking directly to me. It's not a bother, as I don't care to be acknowledged by them. I just find the huge discrepancy btw how I'm treated as a woman and how I'm treated as a non-binary person by cisgender, white men so...surprising? But as I write this, I realize it's really not that surprising...",0,1543959206,a355c5,58,genderqueer
