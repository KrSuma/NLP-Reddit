0,"A day or two ago a post popped up by a girl claiming she was incredibly ill, bedridden, and that her boyfriend had tampered with her birth control. She claimed she needed an abortion. 

You wonderful, helpful people tried to direct her to abortion funds, hotlines, anything that could help. She said she wasn't eligible for any of it... so people started offering money and asked her to set up a gofundme.

While this is all very sweet, if any of you gave her money, you got scammed hard. There is at least one (maybe more) user that goes around posting variations of this story to /r/twoxchromosomes, /r/childfree, /r/assistance and offmychest to get money out of nice people. The mods of these 4 subreddits exchange info and warn each other when she's active so we can be on the lookout. She had posted a different sob story to /r/TwoXChromosomes two weeks before her offmychest post and I just happened to catch it. 

So I'm asking you all to please report any kind of soliciting for donations directly to the mod team for review. There have been cases where I'm able to verify that the person is telling the truth and is not requesting cash, we'll allow their requests.

When we finally won custody of the kiddo, he was having a hard time adjusting to a loving family. He was having trouble with school and getting into fights. We pulled him from his old school and moved about an hour north. He's absolutely flourishing and even has irl friends as well as online ones. I'm so proud of him. I've been telling him we're going to see Endgame next week if he keeps up his good behavior. I bought tickets two days ago and this morning I called into school on his behalf. We're going to a 9am showing. I'm so proud of him. He's had a true hero's journey and his story is just starting.

Me and my girlfriend got invited to a party yesterday by a buddy of mine. I didn't know a whole lot of people who were coming but I decided to tag along anyways. My girlfiend stayed at home because she wasn't really feeling it, so I went there with my friend.

It was at a pretty big house, I think someone's parents left and vacation just started here. There were not that many people despite it being a pretty big place/advertised as a huge party. I ran into my former FWB who I had to cut loose after I started dating my girlfriend. She was being very flirty so I decided to distance myself from her. I had a few drinks and was feeling really messed up already, I think 4 or 5 max. I went to the bathroom and I saw that my pupils were huge. I knew this wasn't okay I felt a bit delirious, so I told my buddy that I wasn't feeling good and I went to lay down on one of the beds.

My memory is hazy after this. I know my FWB came into the room with a friend of hers. I felt weak and couldn't do much in terms of physical movement. They both started touching me and I tried to protest but they were not giving up, and I passed out at some point. I woke up multiple times to them riding me or doing whatever they were doing.

It's been a hell of a ride, but at the same time I've  never been more proud of her than I am right now. She has been in very abusive relationships.

I have been very nervous and anxious that it would be hard to get pregnant, since I did adoption when I had gotten pregnant before, therefore subconsciously terrified that I would be ?punished? so to speak if that makes any sense at all.

14,"I couldn?t believe it when they told me in the ER I was pregnant. I cried. How am I supposed to raise this child? I?m not ready to stop being so selfish. I?m not ready to share my life like that. How about abortion? Oh no, I can?t have one of those. I?ll definitely go to hell if I go through that. Growing up in a Christian household instilled a lot of fear. Adoption ? Oh no, my mother will totally think less of me then. She?ll never let it go. My brothers will never speak to me. My family is all I got. I prayed and begged for a miscarriage or some accident everyday. Sounds harsh but it?s the truth. I wished and prayed that the dude above will just teach me a lesson and then take it all away from me. Soon people started finding out, I let them know I was carrying a child maybe that?ll help me bond with the growing creature. It didn?t. I felt more overwhelmed. It?s as if everyone was excited except for me. I didn?t want to think about my life changing indefinitely. I didn?t want to accept it. I felt like I sucked already. My pregnancy was easy. Gained less than 15 pounds because I didn?t eat much. Gaining weight for someone I didn?t want didn?t seem worth it to me. I gave birth 3 hours after arriving to the hospital. Naturally. I did one push and they told me to stop. There she was. I didn?t feel that bond. No connection. Nothing. I was more worried about me having some complication and dying. I stayed up that night on my phone reading everything that could go wrong with me. They asked for a name and I didn?t know. I wasn?t ready. She was perfect. She didn?t cry often. Rarely. She wasn?t needy. I was detached emotionally from her but little by little there was this thing tugging at me. I?d wake up every hour to make sure she was breathing. I was scared of SIDS. I still worry about it 9 months later. I still wake up to check on her. Now I hug her and I can?t imagine my life without her. I wish I could go back and just give her the unconditional love she deserved then and that she deserves now and forever. She?s become my entire world. I see little kids when I?m away from her and I swear my heart aches. I wish I could be with my tiny human then and there and all the time. I can?t imagine my car without a car seat in the back. I can?t imagine my room without her play pen and all her tiny clothes and her tiny stuff. I can?t imagine my dinner table without her high chair. I can?t imagine doing anything and not having her.

I?m mad that I didn?t enjoy my pregnancy like I should have but I?m also angry at the fact that women have to go through so much in silence. Society puts so much pressure on us. I?m angry that when I thought of my options I couldn?t explore them because of what I thought others would think of me. Women should be able to pick and choose what to do with themselves and their bodies without having that fear of what others might say. I got a lot of messages from my dad saying not to get an abortion. If I didn?t want my baby to just give it to him. That?s ridiculous. I should?ve had that feeling that whatever I chose I would have the support I needed to get through it but I didn?t. People who told me to have my child and raise my child aren?t helping me with her financially or any other way so now I think if I ever go through something like that again or if I would have a redo button I wouldn?t think about what others thought or might say because at the end of the day I am the one living with the consequences of my decisions.

This isn?t so much a ?relationship advice? as it is a ?what the fuck am I supposed to do? advice. (Also a bit of cathartic venting, and throwaway as she knows my normal account)

I?m going to be as honest as physically possible here. It?s probably gonna end up with me getting ripped to shreds, but there?s honestly not much left that can be done to me.

About 6 years ago, I was dating a girl, we?ll call her Angela. Angela told me that her parents used to be swingers, and it kinda saved their relationship. She and I weren?t really in a bad place, and we felt strongly about our confidence in our relationship, so we decided to try it for fun.

We posted an ad on Craigslist and got a relatively immediate response from a couple. The man was about 46 and the girl was 24. We met up at his place and the four of us hit it off. She went with him and I went with her. We?ll call this woman ?Sarah? from here on.

We did the deed, and went home. We felt okay with what happened and it didn?t really lead to any problems. Eventually, thanksgiving comes around, and Angela goes up to Kansas to visit her family for a month. After 3 weeks, I get a message from Angela saying that while she was there, she met up with her ex and is now pregnant with his child, and she promptly leaves.

Come around January first, I get an email from Sarah saying that she had fun and wants to meet up again. I explain what happened with Angela, and that I?m really only interested in a relationship, so if that?s what she?s interested in, then by all means, we can meet.

2 weeks later, we meet up and go on a date. By far the worst date I?d ever been on. We watched blackfish because she was an animal activist, which I respect but I teased her about it, but she fell asleep on me in the middle of the film and I finished it alone in her apartment. We met up about a week later for another date. Then another, and another.

After about 3 weeks of dating, I feel like things are getting serious, or have the potential to do so. At this point, I have a few things I need to disclose if this relationship is going to go any further.

I explain to her that I?m a) polyamorous and b) pansexual. If that?s an issue, I understand, because it?s something a lot of people can?t handle, and not something most people have encountered before. I explain that I?m talking to a few people but nothing is really serious at the moment. She says she understands and is willing to try.

Fast forward to two months later. She?s now living with me in my apartment, and I tell her someone I?ve been talking to is coming to visit, they got a plane ticket and came to Orlando to visit me. She immediately gets upset and starts yelling, then gets quiet out of nowhere. She says she understands and it?s fine.

Two weeks later, the girl comes to visit. She was supposed to stay for a week but bought a plane ticket back home after 3 days. Sarah took every single opportunity to make this girl feel like shit. She attacked her at every turn, degraded her and yelled at her. This girl went back home and I never heard from her again.

Sarah explained that it made her feel like she wasn?t important and that I was just another ?player? looking to fuck as many girls as I could. She cried and we talked about it and long story short I cut off contact with everyone I was talking to with the potential for romance.

Two weeks later, she asks me to hand her her phone. As I lift it the phone screen wakes up and I see not one, not two, but 30 messages from about 5 different guys all asking to meet up with her to fuck again.

I confront her about it, she lies, confront again, she lies, confront again physically showing her the lock screen messages, she lies. I then tell her to get out of my house, and then she owns up. Crying and yelling and saying how she ?did it think we were serious?. She kept saying ?give me my phone? and I set it on the bed behind me, telling her that we need to talk about what?s happening.

That?s when she puts her hands on my chest and shoved me as hard as she can. I hit the wall, and my immediate reaction is to swing back. I hit her. I told her to get out, pack her shit cuz she?s done.

If I?m being honest, I don?t remember much of the next three to five hours, but somehow we decided that she?d stay and we?d try and work on us.

About 4 months later, she goes on a trip with her family for some church thing. Naturally, I?m home alone, and so I get onto the laptop to crank one out. As I open the laptop, it automatically loads skype on her username.

I didn?t think anything of it until a fuckload of messages and notifications started popping up from a known ex of hers. All the messages are mentioning her by name and incredibly sexual.

She gets home and I confront her about the messages and she lies. I open up the computer and show her the proof, and she says ?someone must have hacked it and been messaging that stuff to him? (which is still the stance she takes to this day by the way)

She lied about that, but admitted that she never cut it off with him and they?ve been together behind my back the whole time. Somehow we end up talking it out and she leaves the guy, so we stay together.

Later on I bring up the topic of poly again, and she ?reluctantly agrees?. I start talking to people very slowly and cautiously, and I finally meet someone who I?m interested in. I tell Sarah about her and she immediately starts crying and screaming and throwing things.

After about a week straight of her doing this, I cut things off with anyone I?m talking to and we go back to monogamy.

After about 2 months, we get evicted from our house. A roommate who was a personal friend of mine moved in, stole 1500$ from us and left. It was my fault so I brought everyone to live with my parents. (Me, Sarah and our two roommates.)

One gets a job immediately and moves back to Orlando, the other gets a job locally and moves in with a friend of mine.

She gets a job as a teacher, and I start my own business.

I bring up the idea of poly again, and she throws a fit. Saying that if I want poly, then I don?t want her. She?s not enough and she?ll never be enough.

I ask her if she wants to try being poly as well, not just me, and she?s interested in the idea and we talk about it. I tell her that I?ll start slowly talking to/looking for a partner, and take it slow.

Within three days she had a date. Came home and told me all about it, including sexual details I didn?t want to know. She then had 4 more dates with 3 more guys over the next week. And I sat at home.

After about a month of this, I finally found someone who wanted to go on a date with me. Sarah freaks out and starts crying and yelling at me, and telling me not to have sex on the date with this person. I calmly explain that she had sex on each of the dates she went on, and I?m not specifically looking for sex with this person, but if it comes up, then I?m not going to turn it down.

I go to the persons house and stay the night. It does end in sex, and I leave and come back home. Sarah, is telling me about the date she had while I was gone and how she had sex and it was fun, and I start telling her about my date, and the moment I even mention the other person?s name, she shuts down and starts crying.

After about 2 weeks of her yelling at me and crying I cut it off with everyone, and ?she does too? (more on this later).

She explains to me that she wants something even longer term. ?White picket fence, a house, a dog, a ring, kids? so after about 3 months, we go to the courthouse and get married.

At this point she expected me to ?grow up? and ?move past polyamory?. She had expectations of me that she never once told me. When those expectations weren?t met, it very quickly turned to resentment and anger.

She would snap at me at every turn, screaming and yelling, crying non stop, telling me how horrible I made her feel. She told me I was a narcissist.

We ?tried? poly again, and it ended up in the same failure 2 more times, always ending because she would yell and scream and cry and tell me horrible things.

It?s at this point that my depression and anxiety are to a level they haven?t been in a long time. In the middle of a drive to visit her family, our car breaks down. She starts yelling at me and crying because I?m a horrible person and just want other people and to ?use her?.

It?s at this point that I open the door and start to walk into traffic, because I just want everything to be done. She stops me and we sit in the car in silence until we get towed home.

She finds me a therapist and we start slowly working through things. Talking about past traumas, my relationship, my mentality, everything.

About a year ago, a Netflix special comes out by Daniel Sloss. If you know this name, then you know what?s coming next.

In his stand up, he talks about how people?s lives are puzzles and they fill them with the things that make them happy, and if you?re not happy, it?s because you?re not being true to yourself (summarizing very poorly)

After about a month of thinking, I finally sit down with Sarah and tell her that poly is a part of me. That it?s not something that will go away, leave or change. That it?s something innate in me and I can?t get rid of it. She tells me ?it?s either me or poly? and out of spite, within half a second I said ?poly?.

She screams and yells and yet she still stays with me.

Eventually we get our own place. The day after we get our new house, I have surgery.

Now. At this point I?m not in a relationship with any other people. However I do have a very close friend that I work with who lives in Orlando. She sends a get well card to my new address.

Because I?m still recovering from surgery, I can?t really move around too much. Sarah goes to get the mail, comes back inside and throws the envelope at me and says ?one of your GIRLS sent this to you?

I already know what?s inside because she told me she sent it and what?s inside of it. I calmly tell Sarah ?there?s going to be a Metal Earth pirates of the Caribbean ship and a get well card inside of this?

I open it up and it?s exactly what I say. The card says ?get well, feel better, heal quick! Don?t cut yourself on the metal earth and don?t be afraid to use glue! - Mia?

Sarah screams at me for three days about how it?s a ?love letter? and that I?m doing shit behind her back.

I tell Mia what Sarah said, and laugh saying ?she thinks you?re in love with me, haha? and Mia says ?probably because I am?. I didn?t really know what to say to that so I kinda sat alone and though.

Mia and Sarah knew about each other, as Mia had bought things from me before, and we interacted with work stuff a lot.

Eventually Mia and I start talking more and start tentatively ?long distance dating?. Sarah knows and is upset.

When we moved into this new place I promised Sarah ?this is our home. Nobody is allowed in here without the permission of both of us?.

I finally get a new computer for work, and I don?t need my old one. Mia has been looking for a new computer so I offer to sell her my old one.

I explain this to Sarah and she screams at me for about a week straight, but eventually decides to sell the computer because we could use the cash.

I ask her if she wants to meet Mia, and she says yes. I explain to her that if she wants to meet Mia, then she?s gonna have to crash on the couch. As she lives in Orlando, and is a 5 hour drive from us. Since Sarah gets off work at 6 and it takes her an hour to get home, Mia would be leaving after 7 pm for a 5 hour drive, and I?m not ok with that.

Sarah agrees and we continue the day. The day before Mia comes to get the computer, Sarah asks what the plan is, and I tell her Mia?s gonna come here, get the computer and then we?ll go out in town for a bit to hang out, and we?ll be back by time Sarah gets home so she can meet her. Then Sarah and I can go to bed and she can crash on the couch and leave in the morning.

Sarah starts screaming at me that I?ve broken the sanctity of this house, and that I?ve been plotting this behind her back and that she had no idea I was planning this. That I ?never talked to her about this and this is all a lie?

Sarah tells me that she?s going to stay the night at a friend?s place and I can do ?whatever the fuck I want?.

The next morning Sarah goes to work. I wake up about 3 hours later to a ?get the fuck out of my house or I?m calling the police? text message. I calmly explain that this is my house too and she has no legal ground to kick me out.

Mia comes, buys the computer and goes home. Sarah gets home and she screams at me for 4 days straight.

She finally decides she wants a separation to see if the distance will help us and make us miss each other.

I take my computer back to my parents house so I can work, and stay with them.

After a week, she tells me that she wants a divorce and all my stuff is already packed.

I come by about a week later and grab all my stuff while she?s at work. The entire house is rearranged and every possession of mine is packed in a room by itself. I have a 3 hour breakdown in what was our bed, grab my things and move back in with my parents.

She consistently texts me and asks if I want to hang out, get dinner, have sex, watch shows or a movie. I finally tell her that if ?we?re done then we?re done, and I can?t talk to you, because it breaks me too much?

After 3 days, I realize I haven?t checked my emails since we?ve been separated. So I log in to gmail and it automatically logs her in.

I go to log out and see that there are about 40 emails from kik, and a bunch from other dating sites. Turns out she?s cheated on me with over 70 guys over the course of 3 years (that I can prove)

Also, within 2 days of the ?separation? starting, she threw a party in our home. She?s gone to non stop party after party.

Turns out, the only reason she wanted me to go to therapy was because she hoped he would ?help me get over poly and grow up? and stop ?faking my mental illnesses?.

She has my car, my house and she took everything but my job from me. She hasn?t filed the divorce papers yet even though she surprised me and had me sign them.

My birthday is next month on the 4th. And I?m terrified that she?ll have the final papers sent that day. I?m terrified she?ll come to my parents house. I?m terrified that she?ll get even more vindictive and drag me through the mud.

She?s already spread blatant lies about me to mutual friends and outed me as pansexual and poly to my friends and family.

I genuinely don?t know what to do anymore, and everything reminds me of her. And a part of me still misses her and wants to drop everything to give her whatever she wants. I haven?t heard from her in weeks and I?m falling apart.

What should I do with what I feel? Where do I go from here?

25,"I am typing this with probably the most painful stinging in my chest right now, but I need to share this somewhere. This does contain spoilers for Endgame so... Yeah, if you don't wanna be spoiled, this is the warning. Also... This is gonna be long.

TW for suicide.

So

After Infinity War, there was a time me and my friends had gathered at the ice cream parlor, all trying to relax after what we'd seen. In our conversation, I cracked the joke: ""Hey, what if we dressed up as Avengers for the next movie?"" It wasn't thought about much until a few months later, when Endgame was announced. It was then I brought it up again, this time with the intentions of it being a simple get together.

Of course it was then that my mental health went into a downward spiral. 

My nightmares came back, I was growing paranoid, and anxiety was kicking my ass almost every day. My dad wasn't much help- his laziness and lack of responsibility was weighing on the bills, and my mother was catching up on her own. So, I began to get as many hours as I could for my two jobs- even to the point where I would leave one job only to immediately go the the second. The hours were ruthless, and while I still somehow made time for helping my siblings with homework, I was becoming mentally and physically exhausted. 

It was then that something came by my mind; the plan we had for Endgame. Our get together. It'll be just like the old days... It'll be the one day we all are a group again. I'll actually be there to spend time with you all. Just like old times back in high school, when the most I had worry about was school, and trying to forget my stalker even. It was all easier when you guys were with me.

When the movie was coming near, the plan was forming... And I felt almost at peace putting it together. You guys seemed odd about it, especially when cost came into play.

I was offering to pay for everything for two reasons: One- I was willing to pay any amount of money for a chance you guys will be there for the movie. 2- I wanted my goodbye party to be the most stress free for you guys. I didn't want any of you to worry about money like I normally do, and though the cost of both the tickets and the costumes drained what I had saved, I didn't care. Money was useless to me at the time; once I was gone, I didn't have to worry about it anymore. I wouldn't have to spend long nights feeling ready to keel over from the aches that plagued my body constantly. 

You guys started getting suspicious of me when the premiere day came near. I was talking off, I'll admit, but I was keeping my plan under wraps. I was intending on the night going like this: we gather, get dressed, go someplace we like to eat, see the movie... And I leave the group when we come back. I'll sneak out through the door, go to the train tracks, and wait. It'll be quick, peaceful (I Always loved the sound of trains), and most important: it wouldn't be at home, so I didn't have to worry about my little siblings seeing me. 

The day came, and I felt all kinds of things. I was worried I wasn't doing enough for you guys, and I was wondering if I owed you guys anything else. I didn't. When we got back together, I was so happy again. I never felt so happy in a long time. We met up, we ate... Then we went to the movies. A few people took pictures with us, which was flattering; but I really wanted to see the movie. We got our seats, and the movie started.

Something changed. Like a switch was flipped. I can't say what happened, because I really don't know. But watching the movie, seeing the bonds they had.. It just reminded me of you guys. We were, are, and always will be there for each other. I remember nearly crying when Black Widow and Hawkeye began to fight over who's going off the cliff; it wasn't just because I wanted neither of them to die. 

Then I saw Tony. When he sacrificed himself like that, and when everyone around him, everyone who loved him had to watch him die... I officially changed my mind. I cried for many reasons for that part, from his death all the way to the funeral. So many people loved him. Seeing him gone broke them, and... It was then I knew if I went through with taking my life... You guys would be broken. And I just... Couldn't.

I will admit I don't regret yelling during the return of characters, and I'm glad you all yelled with me. I am glad that we all cheered with the audience, and I am glad to have had a change of heart.

I'm glad I didn't do it. 

I went home that night, and had a short sleep, but... I'm alive. It sounds cheesy, but.. I feel at peace. And while it may be temporary, permanent, or whatever, I promise not to let that happen again. I won't give in to it. I'll fight it for as long as I have to. It brought me to my knees, but I got up. 

You guys supported me for so long, and I feel like the most piece of shit friend for still letting these horrible thoughts of leaving you all come into my head. 

Thank you guys. You really don't know what you did for me, and will probably never know about this... But thank you. I love each one of you and I will try to take control back in my life. My chest doesn't hurt anymore. And when I get home, I'll schedule an appointment with my therapist. I think she deserves an explanation for why I've been missing the previous appointments.

26,"This might not seem like a major ""off your chest"" thing but it is just something that I need to get off my chest. Ok so here goes. 

My dad died 3 years ago the other day and 3/4 (my youngest wasn't born) of my kids took it really hard. They absolutely loved and adored their pap-pap. My 7 yo (4 at the time) daughter is still taking it really hard. She misses him so much. She talks to him all the time, writes him letters, colors/draws him pictures. Well she asked me the one day if we could send the stuff she made/got for him to heaven so he could have it and play with it (she gave him some of her toys). I told her yea. Well we put the stuff in an envelope or package and my husband takes it to ""put it in the mailbox"" on his way to work. On the envelope or package we write ""To: Pap-Pap"" and then where the address goes we write ""Heaven"". I put the stuff up when she's not looking or sleeping so I can give it to her when she is older. I write the date on everything. My 5 yo son does it too and when he does I ""send"" it too but not as often as my daughter does. 

I feel really bad for lying to her about it but she gets super excited when she's making stuff for him or giving him one of her toys to play with so he's not bored and has something to do. I just hope that when she is old enough to know that you can't send stuff to heaven that she doesn't get mad at me for lying to her all these years.",0,1556375752.0,bhznn9,2,offmychest

28,"Man. Even typing that, I feel disappointment in myself. I grew up in a bad home, left at 17 to my best friends, emancipated, as I started my business. I had a promise to myself that if I ever did become a father (never wanted kids) I would be the best, and grateful for my children.
My girlfriend had/has an extremely easy pregnancy, healthy baby, one any struggling parent would shun me for not having gratitude. Everything is perfect, she?s even an easy baby, sweet and pretty. She does make the most adorable noises, and cries rarely. Extremely happy baby. Already and she?s only a month old. 

But almost every time I hold her, I feel a pit of resentment to myself and the woman I had her with.
Someone I was so passionate about just one year ago. 

When we first started dating, I was ecstatic, we were friends for 3-4 years, I always knew she had some issues with her father and home life, in a way we bonded over that. 

She moved away to another city for a year and a half, we drifted apart. I had my growing business to focus on, she wanted to get away from her hometown. Eventually she moved back.

When we started hanging out again, the feelings were unavoidable, we were so much fun together. When we were friends, hanging out was so much fun, every night together was memorable.. then, Every single ?date? we were on, was ecstaticly fun. Ridiculously. She?s an outgoing spirit, I am too. We both can be wildly fun, the life of the party. All of our friends were happy to see us together, and a lot of them had been trying for us to see this happen for years.
It really felt like we were perfect for each other. I felt on top of the world.  


Then, 4 months into this new relationship, almost a year after she moved back, she came pregnant. I was excited, how could I not be. I?m having a baby with my best friend, this won?t be easy, but nothing in my life has. I can handle this, and with my business exploding over the last year and a half, I can support us. My life, I finally feel somewhat complete in this. I was excited 

To make a short story out of this, 3 months into the pregnancy I found out that the first month of our relationship she was cheating, still seeing a guy that was in a relationship until about 3 weeks into our serious relationship (at this point, we had agreed to be exclusive)

I won?t say I didn?t know she could be promiscuous, I will say that I didn?t think she would do that to me, her friend; and at that point romantic partner.

I immediately grew distant. Resentment, not hatred, but for a while I couldn?t stand being around her. Even now I still get these feelings and have to take my time away. I don?t know how to make them disappear, for me cheating was awful, the worst thing that someone could do, and generally a major deal breaker for me. My father would cheat on my mom, leave town with women and I?d be home with my mother and hear her crying, eventually becoming old enough (9-10) to understand what was happening before their divorce.

Since then, our relationship went from good to immediately sour. Over the course of a week I completely shut out, and over months fights became worse, insults thrown. Resentment built, all while pregnancy was blooming. Eventually, at 7 months into the pregnancy I decided enough was enough I?m going to look past (she really fought and has been fighting to earn my trust and repair what she broke, I truly believe she wouldn?t cheat again and would never break the family unit, she doesn?t want a broken home like hers was either) 
I know I?m the problem, I can?t stand to think about the cheating and it makes me resent her. 
I feel like a push over, I feel weak. Like the image of my mother sobbing on the couch while my dad did as he pleased. I know it?s not that way, I know she?s trying to rebuild this relationship. I know it?s me now that is making things hard, but I feel a lot of resentment, especially around her. I had baby with a cheater, a family with a cheater, and there?s nothing I can do to escape that reality.

My wife was meant to be in the wedding, standing by her sister on one of the most important days of her life. The drive would be 8 1/2 hours, and we knew we would likely pass through a bad rain storm along the way. We had taken special points to have her car completely checked out to try and minimize the risk as we made the substantial trip to Tulsa.   
 

The trip had gone without incident for 6 hours  and we found ourselves driving on a dark Texas highway near Paris around 11pm. At this point, the rain that had been coming down in thick sheets was finally slacking off. I even looked over to my wife and commented that we had made it through the worst of it-only 2 ? hours left. Nothing could have prepared me for how positively wrong I was. Not 10 minutes after I made this comment, I saw in my rear view mirror one of the most haunting images I have, or likely will ever see:  
 

Headlights.   
 

These headlights were bearing down on us faster than I ever could have thought possible. I had enough time to say out loud ?we?re going to be hit?, try to maneuver the car away from the person careening towards us at nearly 100 miles per hour, and offer up one word, half in prayer - half in panic. ?Help?.

I will never forget the urge to panic when I looked over and saw my wife writhing in agony and confusion, I will never forget the pain of my injuries, and I will never forget the fear that fell upon me when I watched my Wife...my best friend stop mid-sentence, go unconscious, and leave me wondering if She had taken her last breath.  
 

Thankfully, though, people heard our cries for help amidst the rain that had been falling unaware of the situation it landed upon. We were pulled out of the vehicle, brought to Paris, TX and Life Flighted to a Medical Center a few hours away. My injuries included broken ribs, a sprained ankle, a sprained wrist, a dislocated hip, a dislocated shoulder, and two broken bones in my right arm as well as extensive bruising. My injuries, however, were nothing compared to my wife's. She had broken ribs, a thrice broken femur, a broken fibula, 3 torn ligaments in her knee, a sprained ankle, a shattered wrist, trauma caused by impacting the airbag-less dashboard which included a broken bone under her eye socket and resulting in severe eye sight loss that still hasn?t returned.

These injuries would be enough to quell even the strongest of spirits...but my wife, the strongest person I have ever met in my entire life, met each and every challenge with more determination than I ever could have imagined. Her sheer force of will captivated the entire floor of nurses, and even caught the attention of the head of the Hospital. She is my hero.

41,"We dated for three years. We lived together during college for two. I was a year ahead of her in school, and I graduated last May and moved four hours away for work. We were doing the lost distance thing for 10 months, and then two weeks ago she ended it. She was accepted into the masters program at her school, so we would have had to continue doing long distance for another two years. She said it would be too hard, and despite seeing the writing on the wall, I have totally fallen apart.

We're still friends. And I believe we will always be friends. After two weeks of reflection, I decided this was probably for the best. We had fairly different career goals and I knew that would become an issue in the long term for us.

But it is the loneliness that is killing me. Every day since the breakup, I have been feeling absolutely no motivation to go to work. I aquired a great, high paying job right out of college. And right now it means nothing. I am doing less at work, just waiting for the clock to hit 5:00. I see people around me in their happy relationships, getting married, and I think about myself and my brain just spirals into every stupid mistake I've ever made with no way of stopping ... I hate myself. I hate that I can't control what I'm feeling.

I've started drinking more. Every day after work. It's the only thing I look forward to on weekdays. I also (finally) found a weed dealer in my new city, so that's a thing now too.

I decided to use this breakup as an opportunity to explore my bisexuality. I have always known that I was bi, but never had the chance to experience something with another guy. So I get on Tinder, Grindr, and Bumble and start making some connections. And I found a guy. It was so weird because of how quickly we matched each other and just how much we had in common. We hit it off. We texted every single day for a week and planned a solid first date. Well, that fell through. And the day after that he started acting weird with me and not replying. Well, this sort of made me absolutely freak out. That whole day I was anxious that I did or said something wrong. I probably shouldn't fall apart for someone who I hadn't even met in person yet, but I couldn't help getting so attached so quickly ...

I'm a 20-year-old girl, and I've never kissed or been kissed, never had a boyfriend, never have been intimate with anyone.  
Even though it bothers me, I reassure myself by telling myself that 20 years old isn't that old and I'm still young and it's could still be considered normal by most. I really believe that.  
But sometimes there are things that remind me of how inexperienced I am, and how I wish I was more experienced. Earlier today I was watching a youtube video and they were talking about their first kiss, and the mistakes they made during their first kiss, and I had no idea what they were talking about (well, I understand the theory).  
When I was younger, I dreamt of my first kiss and hoped it would be romantic. It was important to me, and know I feel like now I'm too old for it to be the sweet innocent kiss I dreamt about. And I still kind of do dream about it, but not that much anymore...  
The worst part about not having kissed a boy is that it's wasn't a choice I made. There just never have been any boy interested in me, and I don't know why.   
For a long time, I thought it was because of my physique since I have been overweight since I was 10 and obese for a few years now. But I realized that even if it was unattractive to some guys, that couldn't be a turn off for every guy I met.  
So it must be my personality. And that's where it gets tricky. I don't know what's wrong with my personality.

Recently I applied for the pilot role in my countries air force, and did an aptitude test, to which I managed to unlock literally every job in the defence force. Hearing this, I was over the moon, and obviously chose pilot. I had a quick chat to the nurse there, who does the medical interviews, and I mentioned it, which she said it may have to be looked at, so I thought it may be all good, and didn't worry. 

I've had kyphosis since I was 5, and from 10-15 is where it reared its ugly end, and my back hurt occasionally (muscles, not bones thankfully). I went to see a surgeon about it at 13, and he ordered me to get some X rays done, and my back angle was apparently 60 degrees (mild) from what he saw. Bad, but doable. Now, as of being 17, I think it is down within the ""normal"" range (20-40 degrees), and last time I had pain was over a year ago.

Since it was past, I thought it wouldn't be an issue, but clearly it isn't. 

Luckily they let people contest the decision, even though back and neck issues usually permanently rule people out.

My best friend (D) was killed last weekend. I've known him since we were ten and he just turned thirty. I only even remember a few years that he wasn't in my life. D was more like a brother to me than my actual brothers, I think. 

D went through some serious shit but he always bounced back somehow. I watched him lose his mother to cancer, graduate high school, join the military and deploy, come home to be the first in his family to finish a 4-year degree, and teach himself guitar. He was a brilliant man academically and musically and we never failed to tell one another how proud we were.

He had some drinking problems in the past that he overcame but old habits die hard I guess. A night of drinking led to a dumb choice and now he's gone. It wasn't vehicular, but it wasn't pleasant. Or quick. Or painless. I spent three nights unable to sleep, imagining how he must have felt waiting for EMTs. He made it to the hospital but not much further.

54,"When I entered Middle School, I lived abroad in another continent. I went to an american school and it was my first contact with English language, culture and education system with this school. I first met this kid who started being my friend and he was about the same age but a school year more. We lived in the same complex and he along with his brother invited me to his house to play videogames. Everything was cool with him until there.

Later after, he started being a fake and being an asshole because he probably found new friends and thought he was super cool because he was into Korn and Metallica. I was around 14 and he was like 13. We shared the same school van to go to school since we kind of lived close and he started saying horrible shit to me and my sister for no reason, or I assumed, to look tough in front of friends. He completely lost friendship with me and started being a complete piece of shit. 
There are many episodes in which he acted like a total bully to me and my sister, who was probably 3 years younger than him. He once grabbed her lunchbox and threw it against the ground, breaking everything she had there. He once crashed her finger against a reclining seat, causing her a gash. She was 11 when this happened. Other things were that the dude thought he was super badass playing soccer so he gatekept everyone he did not like in the game. He once fouled me real hard causing me a subtle injury. One day while playing soccer in recess I confronted him and almost got into a fight, but the bell rang and acted like nothing happened. 
His dad organized soccer practices and games for fun in the housing complex and I was there. Dude was so cowardish that he didnt say shit to me when his dad was there and he acted like nothing happens.

When the incidents happened with my sister she told my mom (she was 10-11) and my mom called this guy?s mom to talk about this. To my surprise, he came to my house to talk about this but with his mom. The funniest shit was that SHE was the one that talked, defending him, saying how much of a good boy he was. It?s funny how a kid that loved Metallica and Korn let his mommy defend him against bully allegations. Months after, he just stopped doing shit like this.

Fast forwarding to around 2015, I went to a metal show (band was Baroness) in my city and he was there. I saw him and i saw he saw me and had like a ?i know this dude? look. Nothing happened but it subtly made me think horrible things. I wanted to beat him up so bad.

Turns out I felt sorry for my sister and myself for not beating him up when I was 13-14. Now that I am 23, if I see him again I woud find any chance to make his life impossible and beat his ass.

For the past year I have been clubbing 2-3 nights per week. At first I used to love it. I came from a very strict upbringing so when I turned 18 and started paying my own bills my parents gave me all this freedom. It was so fun being drunk all the time, and the occasional MDMA roll.

It's now been a year and a half since I broke up with my ex (1 year relationship) and alot has happend between us. The first few months after our break-up we still behaved like a couple. We met up, kissed and still loved each other but she just did not want to be in a relationship anymore. It frustrated me so much. Then things got bad. She started seeing another guy and at that point I tried to stop all contact between us. After a few months I recieved messages and letters from her saying that she missed me and did not want our friendship to disappear. She told me that she broke up with the other guy and that she just wanted to wait and see what the future would bring and what would become of us. So I started seeing her again.

I feel like she does not really bother and it makes me so insecure. But somewhere I get this good feeling that maybe things will be alright. Then a few weeks pass and I start to feel like shit again. I feel ignored and start thinking she already has found some else or moved on while in reality this is not the case.

I spilled my guts out, telling her that I still love her and that I just can't cope with the fact that us behaving like friends just makes me feel more heartbroken and ignored.

She refuses to split the work between me and two of my other coworkers, only pretending to appear to the supervisor that she does do work--only she doesn't! There's two particular tasks that we do: filing and delivering. She apparently ""loves"" delivering and will jump at any given chance in order to do so.

I asked her to file once... and she told me yes... only to ""forget"" and continue doing whatever she is doing.

74,"At the time, I had post partum anxiety and I wasn't sleeping (baby wouldn't sleep longer than 45 minutes day or night for 3 straight months) or eating (kept puking due to the stress). Also, my baby fell off a makeshift bed (that was in her room for me to sleep on)about 1 foot into a padded and carpeted floor, because, looking back, I was horribly sleep deprived and wasn't thinking straight probably due to lack of nutrition. (I had no help then...still don't really, but that isn't important). We went to the ER and they said she was fine, but it still shook me to the core.

That was nearly 2 years ago. My child turns 2 in about a little more than a month (beginning of June). She is ahead on every milestone and, like her middle name suggests, she is the Joy of my life. Unfortunately, the surrounding circumstances are less than ideal, but she is truly a ""unicorn"" toddler. Or maybe I think that the toddler years just aren't as bad as the newborn phase since I had an incredibly difficult newborn with colic that I had to handle on my own. Who knows? 

Anyway, I didn't originally talk about any of this, because the fall happened. I felt that if people knew I had terrible thoughts that they would think the fall wasn't an accident (it truly was and I hate myself to this day for it even though my child is very advanced...I'm talking she is starting to read and the librarians at storytime point to her and say that ""she is the one who can read"" to the other librarians). So I kept it all in. Even if I committed suicide, there would be no evidence of these thoughts since, well, a bullet would have pierced the only place these thoughts were stored.

Now that there is a significant amount of time that had passed and no major events, I feel like it is finally time that I can tell someone.

The truth is that I planned my suicide back then. I was going to plastic wrap my bed and surrounding areas before I dropped my newborn off at the local fire station. Then I would come home and shoot myself in the head. Then they could just roll me up and throw me away after. I was even going to seriously do it one night, but my daughter actually fell asleep on the way to the fire station and I was able to regain some hope.

I honestly chose a gun, because I had tried a few different ways before (nearly two decades ago - belts break, you puke, etc...) and I needed something quick, irreversible and sure to do the trick.

I also reached out to someone that night. I won't ever tell that person, but that person pushed me away. I wanted to say ""I'm going to kill myself"", but instead I just let that person know that it was ok and that I wasn't mad at that person or anyone. I later learned that person was playing an elaborate game with me that started a little after I got pregnant because that person wanted me to be a better parent or something crazy like that. It also helps that I can't tell that person, since I don't talk to that person anymore nor do I want to - for the games the person played left it's intended scar.

And that is it. I was originally crying over what I felt back then earlier, like I have a few times before, but as I write this, I honestly feel nothing which is actually more than I could have hoped for. It means it is losing its emotional hold on me.

I am new to the profession of education, I started with high hopes and ambitions to be the difference, be the teacher I wish I had growing up. As a 25 black latino in America, representation is HUGE in the world of education, and I knew that my role would be important in helping uplift the next generation to be great and believe in themselves. I taught High School English in Colorado, in a district with 85% Hispanic population, yet literally 90% of teachers staffed are white and often unable to truly connect with the daily struggles these kids face, Trumps election was a nightmare for many of my students who then began to fear that their families may be deported. Anyway, my rookie year teaching, I had a knack for it. I actually felt prepared in my year long residency despite going into massive debt to become one of the lowest paid professions but that?s another shit filled rabbit hole I?d rather not go down in this post. Throughout the year, however, I was harassed by my coworkers. 

I received an email from one (white male) because I allowed one of his students to be practice her presentation in front of my advisory that explained that my actions negatively affect every teacher in the building and everyone has an opinion about my style of teaching, this was almost verbatim. My then principal (white male) decided to host a restorative meeting in which he sat in silence and allowed this veteran teacher to continue spewing toxic jealousy onto a first year educator. We have a full time ?instructional coach? (white female) on staff who?s sole job is to observe teachers and give advice and coaching, as the name suggests. However, my coach saw me teach for literally  all of 15 minutes for the entirety of my first year, but spent time weekly with another first year teacher (white male). Despite these altercations and many more I could disclose here, I was nominated for ?Rookie Teacher of the Year? by the district for my classroom assessment scores and the growth students showed. I hosted and organized the schools very first Talent Show (no extra pay), hosted an after school video game club (no extra pay), as well as a during lunch LGBTQ club (no extra pay). Against my better judgment I returned to the school that next fall (this past August) because of the students. 

Things between coworkers and myself were even worse, despite a huge staff turnover. Seems as though my skin color was enough of a deterrent that I wasn?t invited to staff outings, wasn?t spoken to in passing in the halls, or welcomed in the staff lounge. I walked in to grab something out the fridge one day and as I entered I heard laughing and words exchanged but after they saw it was me that entered, it became dead silent and everyone proceeded to look at me. I said ?wow, this makes me uncomfortable, why?re y?all staring?? One teacher (white female) then explained that if I felt uncomfortable it was my own fault... really?? It?s my fault for feeling uncomfortable when you stare at me? Okay. You right. My bad. Anyway, among the huge staff turn over brought a new principal (white female) whom I confided in that I didn?t feel welcomed by the staff but am here for the kids, I really loved my advisory and the bond we shared. She brushed this off. The following week the district needed forms submitted for the new clubs that?ll take place that year, this time they?d be compensated for those who put in the time. I submitted forms for the LGBTQ and video game clubs I started the previous year and thought it?d be nice to finally be compensated for the time I?m putting in. However, the principal gave the LGBT club to a new staff member (white female) in order to ?share the wealth.?  It hadn?t even occurred to her that it wasn?t her club to just give away to someone new. Things between myself and staff were just as uncomfortable and fucked up as they were the previous year and I?m not sure why I thought to even come back. But the kids, the kids are the center of my work and I thought I?d rough out the school year for them... that is until a student (Latino) decided to post on his Instagram page this past December that ?there are teachers fucking students at the school,? of course this gets massive attention by his following and he further spreads rumors to different students saying it?s Mr X and this person, Mr X and that girl, Mr X and this other girl... (I?m Mr X if that was hard to follow).  

His advisor (white female) sees the post and then reports me to the principal, which I understand, we need to ensure the safety of our kids first, but even after she reported me, she said nothing to me about it. Pretended that I wasn?t under investigation and tried to collaborate with me the whole time. In January the principal drags me into the office and then catches me up on the whole rumors and investigation and discloses that I?m not under suspicion any longer. But the thing is, why was this believed in the first place? Something so flimsy, something that literally anyone could say aloud. The principal began to grovel and pretend as though she cared about my feelings in the situation but it wasn?t genuine. Had she truly cared, the boy who posted these slanderous rumors would have been more seriously reprimanded and there would have been a public announcement to devoid the rumors of any validity. But there wasn?t. Another month rolls by after the investigation and I missed a day of work to be with my sister for her birthday. I returned to school the next morning with several students asking where I had been with a loon of concern on their faces. I asked why the look and they skirted around the topic until finally one said ?we?ll we just thought the rumors were true and you had been fired? 

That hurt me to my core. That these kids I had given my all would believe something said about me that terrible, and I knew that the rumors were still spreading, I could feel the tension and the stares from my kids ever since January when school got back in session.  I left work early and went to my HR rep and got approved for FMLA pending therapist recommendation. I thought taking time away would allow for me to heal and for the school to fix their wrongdoing. But it didn?t, nor did they. I then took my story to a cousin of mine who has been an attorney longer than I?ve been able to talk, and she knew that i had a case on my hands. Not only was my name slandered but I was clearly discriminated against in the workplace. I called my union rep (white female) and told her my story as well as what my cousin suggested I do. At the time I was venting emotionally, but a bad idea because now I know the union rep really only has the districts best interest, not the teachers. Weeks of back and forth with her and the assistant superintendent (white female) and they pitched me the offer to sell my contract and resign from the district, meaning that I?d receive my regular compensation and health benefits until September without needing to work for them again. I took the offer and forfeited my right to sue them. I?m trying to still get over this but I truly do not know how. I had a real passion for education and had ambitions of owning and operating a school with a unique curriculum that would inspire the country to change their approach to education. But after all this, I lost the flame. I was scorned by my coworkers and administration. I was even scorned by the very kids I decided to stay in a toxic environment for. It?s been a month since I?ve signed the papers but im not over it. I?ve been going thru a crisis since then in trying to determine if I should move to another state, try another profession, go to law school, move abroad, etc. I still have no clue. But I?ve been getting high much more than usual to avoid what I?m feeling. 

I?ve tried therapy since all this started, going between 4 different people and paying 4 different out of pocket bills. Another shit filled rabbit hole I?d rather not get into; America?s health care system
 
Anyway, on 4/20, ironically, I received a phone call from the principal (black female) of my old elementary school. She had saw my accomplishments and things I?ve done in the classroom that I posted on social media, and asked if I would be interested in teaching at her school as a middle grades English teacher. I didn?t expect the phone call, let alone a job offer, but I hesitated. I decided to tell her what happened to me while I?ve been living in Colorado and she was shocked and saddened. I let her know that I truly appreciated her thinking of me for the position but I?m just not sure if education is something I can get back into. Although I told her I?d think on it,  I?ve sense been sober (day 6 now) and it?s extremely hard. Cannabis is my coping mechanism through this shitstorm that I survived and now I have to take an extended break from it just to piss clean in another state. I hate that we have this fucked up State Laws versus Federal Laws debate and especially over cannabis. But that?s it. That?s what I needed to get off my chest. I?m still very much so lost in what to do next with my life but dealing with the now is hard enough.

So a bit over a year ago, her BF was visiting the city I used to live in (he came up every couple of years to hit up some breweries, and I suspect, just to GTFO). He hit me up, asked if I wanted to go out for a drink, I said sure. We grab some beers, he mentions they'd broken up. This was a bit before Christmas a couple of years ago. He suggests I give her a call to say hi on Christmas, as he thinks she's probably gonna be lonely. He also mentions she's probably looking for a roommate; he was still paying his half of rent on the 2 bedroom apt they had been in, but it was an expensive apt, and she didn't make enough to cover it.

The way I drive (... that's probably a legit complaint), the way I cook family recipes, the friends I have (I used to be heavy into drugs, and I've remained very close friends with friends from that scene who cleaned up), even my work hours, and why I ""can't get a real job"" (I work a couple of 1099 jobs, and make significantly more than she does, but I don't work a ""real job"" because I set my own hours). I've even been told ""wow, I've never known anyone poor enough to buy clothes at Goodwill"" (seriously? they have some awesome clothes if you dig a bit, and I'd rather put money in savings vs going to Macy's)...

I guess the tl;dr is her worry that I'm gonna dump her for a guy is basically making sure I will dump her for a guy (or at least, dump her). I don't like dumping people, and with only one exception, I've remained close friends with every ex I've had. I owe her a lot for helping me move to the city I really wanted to live in, but the mental hell I'm going through makes me want to sleep under a bridge.

He was obviously popular in our class for being a witty, talented person. Toward the end of year though, I realized something, he was me. The me that I always aspired to be. He was schooling his acads and he was an avid learner. His talents and creativity knew no bounds. He had a friend circle wider than Earth itself and he was the most comedic person I?ve ever seen. He even had the family that I always wanted. A sister that wasn?t the spawn of satan, an older sibling that was there for him, and a present mom. My reaction of course wasn?t anger or envy to 613 and even my family, but despair and sadness. I beat myself up over the fact that If I had made myself better, I could?ve been just like him. If you were expecting an inspiring and bright end to this then just throw that out the window now. It isn?t always that people have the strength to rise up and do better.

In the middle of the night a couple of weeks ago, I woke up to you flowing through my mind. It was strange. I had forgotten about our relationship, but the feelings I felt were running through my veins. My stomach had butterflies, and I let a wave of nostalgia wash over my mind. I don't know if I miss you, or I just miss the times we had together. You treated me like shit, yet at the same time showed intense interest. Your friends said you were trying to make me jealous, but is that the truth? Were you interested, but the only way you could get my attention was through trying to make me jealous, or was it that you truly didn't care about me. The sad thing is that we never officially dated; we were always stuck in this limbo. You were two years younger than me, so our relationship wasn't legal, and we both knew that.

I've never had feelings like I had for you. I remember you asking me if I had a facebook, and then you accidentally spilled the beans: you already knew the answer to that question since you had found it, already. Little did I know that you being my lab partner was going to the best and worst decision of my life. In the second week of class, I remember looking over at your phone; you had my name with hearts as my contact. I would of made moves right then and there, but again, any relationship we had wasn't legal, and I wasn't willing to put my life in the hands of someone else. I learned that through growing up with my father.

I wasn't scared. I mean I was. I was scared that our age difference would cause problems. I was scared how you had so many friends to hangout with, while I had none because I just moved there out-of-state.

I remember you were always hanging out with other guys. Granted, it was a group of guys that your bestfriend hung out with, but it made me feel insecure; they were a threat to me. It sounds so stupid now that I write it out, but I wasn't going to chase a girl that constantly hung out with other guys. I pushed you away for that reason, as well. I felt that you weren't a stable enough choice, but I regret it so much.

I remember that I started dating a chick from my work when we had our second semester together. You would always questioned me about her. Who is she? How did we meet? How old is she?

I remember when you started dating that one guy. He slowly stole you away from me. You would constantly put pictures of him on snapchat.

I felt like we were in some battle of who could make the other person more jealous.

I remember when you invited me to come over and hangout with your friends. You guys were pretty drunk and high, laying on the roof while looking at the stars. You had just got your wisdom teeth removed that week. You were on pain meds, yet you were still drinking and smoking. What happened to the girl that hated those things? I lectured you on it, but you wouldn't listen. Eventually we all went up to the roof to lay down and watch the stars, again. You remember the guy that you had told me about a couple of weeks before? The guy that you said you knew since middle school? The one who I told you to be careful of? The one you told me was disgusting in just how he acted, didn't shower, treated people, etc? I remember. I remember you purposefully cuddling with him in front of me. It broke my heart. You did it for a while as I just laid next you. You may it painfully clear that it was to make me jealous. Finally, I told you that we needed to go downstairs and talk. You fought it. You were slurring your words, saying you were drunk. The only reason you came downstairs is because your friends said I sounded serious. You sat on the couch while I asked you what was up. Why were you drinking while on pain meds? Why were you cuddling with this guy in front of me? What is going? I felt like I was in movie; it was so surreal. You said that since we weren't dating, you could do whatever you wanted. I told you that you needed to stop this stuff, and stop hanging out with these people. You said I sounded just like your ex. You didn't care. You eventually said I was the bad guy for trying to talk you about stuff while you were drunk. You said that you were going back upstairs and that you didn't care. I told you that if you did that, any friendship we had was over. You left, and our friendship was over. To make sure you were safe, I texted your best friend about what you were doing and left our relationship behind. 1 year gone. I don't think you thought I would actually carry through with it, but its been two years now. Two years.

I remember you got caught with weed at church, since someone ratted you out. How stupid was that? Gosh, why would you do that? I felt so bad for you. I remember seeing you before class all sulken, and I wanted to give you a hug so bad. I wanted to wrap my arms around you, but you did something a week before, that I just couldn't. You said you weren't going to class, and left.  I wish I would have hugged you.

I remember us being in class one day, you looked me in the eyes, and said I was like a brother to you. It was weird. It was out of nowhere. It had no context what so ever. Even our lab partner questioned it. I always wondered why you had said that. You waited, looking at me in the eyes after that, almost waiting for a reaction. You were waiting for me to react. I just acknowledged it and went along with it. It seemed liked situations like that were common. It always seemed like you were always doing something to try to make me jealous, and it pushed me away even more. I'm a stubborn person and couldn't allow myself to give into something like that.

I texted you and asked if you wanted to talk about things. You agreed and said tomorrow, since you were hanging out with your friends. You sounded so excited. The next morning, we met at starbucks, and it went a lot different than what I expected. You didn't have the bubbly personality you usually had. You were monotone, and you said that I was just a ""backup"" to you. That's all I remember.

We really haven't talked since then. You've texted me around every 4-6 months asking how I am doing. The first one I told you to leave me alone. The second time, I told that I was doing fine.

I didn't deserve her, she didn't deserve all of that. She deserves someone who loves her the same way that she loves them.

I am adopted from Vietnam at the age of 9 months, or so. I was adopted by an American family. I've always felt different. It might have been the fact that I was the only Asian in a community full of Native Americans, Whites, and Hispanics. Or who knows, maybe I had an extra arm coming out of my head. I've always been severely bullied. If you're Asian and if you've dealt with racism, you know the usual degrading insults like ""Ching chong"", ""chink eyes"", and ""Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees and look at me"". It made me feel like complete shit as anyone would feel, I would assume. In the middle of the year of 2nd grade, I was taken out of public schools and put into home school. Except, I didn't do anything. I was young and clearly, I didn't know what the shit to do and the adults of the house didn't give a shit. The whole no educating basically slaving away fiasco lasted for about 4 years. When I mean slaving away, I really mean slaving away. We (my family) lived in a pretty big house considering we had a huge family. Well, every day, we had to clean every inch of the house. We had to pick rocks up from the property (which was also huge and in the area we live in, getting rid of rocks in quite useless). Many of us (the adopted kids) also dealt with physical, mental, emotional, verbal--you name it--abuse. We were told many times that we were going to be sent back to Vietnam, that there were many reasons why no one else wanted to adopt us, that when we were taken back to Vietnam we'd end up as hookers on the streets only to be found dead in a ditch. I also encountered almost being lit on fire. I've talked about the person who tried to do so about this and they said it was the only logical punishment.

Anyways. Time passed and the person who abused us was a victim of an attempted murder by another adult figure in the house. Well, all of the kids had to lie and were manipulated through the whole process. We had to lie to counselors, CYFD, the police, social workers, etc. We were also put back in public school and I was held back a year. However, recently I found out that I shouldn't have been held back as I tested above the school, as well as the state. Anywho's. The whole court process lasted up to 5 years and due to the amazing justice system, it is still going on. I've come out with the truth and what I knew about the attempted murder and nothing has made a difference. During the 4 years between now and the attempted murder, I was fucking depressed. I self harmed, I planned my suicide, I attempted suicide, etc. I was fucking alone. No one cared for me. Literally. I am not trying to victimize myself. I had no friends, my family/relatives were doing pretty swell because they had an amazing social life/support system and yeah. I never left my room aside from going to school. I went to school, came back home and went to my room.

Irrational thoughts are a terrifying thing to experience because of how incredibly stupid it always feels once you're out of them. I can't believe I ever believed that stuff.

I had my standards so high for graduating with every possible honor that I've been burning out in slow motion for the last 2 semesters, but... with my catastrophizing standards so high, I forgot that I'm still graduating on pretty great terms for an average person.

103,"Ugh. I really need to get this off my chest. I can?t talk about this with anyone I know. It?s 5am and I?m lying awake thinking of it. 

A little background on me: I?ve been in a loving relationship for the last year and have never this happy before. We?re currently long distance and hoping to close the gap in a little over a year. I can?t wait to really start my life with him then. In my eyes, he?s the one for me. 

I started a new job a few weeks ago at one of my ideal companies to work for. Instead of working on my own (like my last job) I now work in a team of 3 others. Everyone has been super nice and helpful with the on boarding process. 

A few days into my job I started noticing one of the guys on my team a bit. He?s similar to my type (on the short-ish side with facial hair) and has a cute little accent that really adds to it. I didn?t really think much of it until I started getting little butterflies sitting beside him in meetings or chatting with him. 

Now, I don?t think there?s anything wrong with noticing someone and there being an attraction while being in a relationship. Why I?m nervous is because in my last relationship, I did cheat. I was not in a healthy relationship, was incredibly unhappy and couldn?t leave, and infidelity was a means of escaping it. As terrible as I feel about myself for cheating, part of me doesn?t regret it because I learned a lot - I learned how badly I needed out of the relationship that was breaking me down mentally and physically. I also learned I want to be a loyal partner and not stray again, ever. I don?t want to be the ?once a cheater, always a cheater? type of person. I know who I am and I?m a good person, and I?m not defined by my bad choice (or so I try to tell myself). 

You?re probably wondering, ?well, if you say you?re not going to cheat then why are you nervous??. Well, mainly because I associate feelings of attraction in a relationship with my past, and because I have an inkling he might be interested in me. He?s asked to grab lunch with me before (just 1-on-1) and I?ve usually just made an excuse so I don?t put myself around him more than I need to. Lunch might be harmless, right? Well yesterday after a work happy hour we both left at the same time and were chatting. As we were about to head our separate ways, he says ?hey, any chance you want to take a walk??. These could all be completely harmless and I?m blowing it out of proportion, but after that I don?t think so. Even if I didn?t have a boyfriend, I wouldn?t go there because we work so closely together and I really like where I work, and wouldn?t want to mess it up. 

He seems respectful enough and yes, knows I have a boyfriend. At the moment I?m not able to distance myself much from him since we?re on the same team and have a few clients we work on together, and he?s able to help catch me up to speed on everything and provide context while I?m still new. Unless they do a team move around, or he gets promoted and moves to another team, I?m likely stuck with him. 

Part of me feels like I?m crazy for being nervous when a) I trust myself and know I wouldn?t do anything (first and foremost). I love my boyfriend and wouldn?t do that to him. And b) he hasn?t even shown a crazy amount of interests/seems respectful anyways. Im not sure why that is but I think all I can do is just keep all talk/interaction work related and avoid him otherwise. Ahhh.",0,1556367215.0,bhyhp6,1,offmychest

109,"This is the second time he's been accused of child molestation. I'm not privy to the details of the first accusation (from the family of a girl his girlfriend used to babysit), but there was apparently no legal action taken (they were small town folks, so my best guess is it was a ""if we ever see you again you'll regret it"" type situation.) This time it was his step-granddaughter and her parents, likely taking the previous event into account, immediately pressed charges. He left town (the mark of an innocent man, surely) but was found and arrested at his parents' house. A year later, he's just had a preliminary hearing and is boasting to anyone who will listen about how apparently half the evidence was stricken by the judge and that his lawyer said they had ""a big win.""

I have zero evidence to back up my opinion on his guilt, just my own personal perception of all the creepy things he's said over the years, like talking about the underwear the first accuser wore, or, most disgustingly, joking about how she was ""bald"" when someone else made a pubic hair joke (that didn't involve children), among other weird shit like being a member of a website back in the day that counted down the days until the Olsen Twins' 18th birthday and making creepy comments about other young teen actresses. He also makes more references to things like deletion software than a person with nothing to hide would and gets extremely paranoid about really fucking inconsequential shit like e-mail addresses (his laptop's webcam is taped over, too) and used to have cameras set up outside his front door with the monitor in his computer room and would make other people answer the door unless it was someone he was expecting (even the day he was arrested, he had made his elderly mother answer the door.) The problem is, it sounds like a lot of the testimony included things like these, which while damning in the court of public opinion, aren't admissible in a real trial (but clearly some evidence still exists or else there wouldn't be an actual trial coming up.)

He's also a racist, misogynist, abusive asshole and a big part of me hoping he would be found guilty is so that he'd finally experience comeuppance for being such a general piece of shit his whole life.

So why am I still in contact with him? Personal weakness, I guess. Another part of me hoping he'd go to prison was so it'd be easy for me to cut him out. Aside from my brother and grandparents, he's the only family I have contact with, and my relationship with said grandparents will get extremely strained the moment I come out against their little angel. There was actually a large period of almost a year where I didn't go out of my way to talk to him after I first reflected on everything and decided that he had probably indeed touched the first girl (and yes, this was before the second accusation even came. That's how weak I am.)

117,"I (f) have a friend (m) in my social circle who is really close with many of my closest friends. He's a nice, chill, down-to-earth guy, albeit a bit awkward. I was at a mutual friend's birthday party a while back and both my boyfriend and I individually had some really nice one-on-one conversations with him and really hit it off. We both exchanged numbers with him to hang out again in the future, maybe make dinner together as both he and boyfriend both love to cook. 

&#x200B;

After the party, he messaged us casually a few times to say it was nice to chat, we should hang out, what are you guys up to this weekend? However, as time went on, he always messaged me and not my boyfriend. Over time, his chatting with me became more frequent and more personally engaged?i.e. proposing deeper conversation topics, asking more personal questions about me, generally wanting to engage on a deeper level than what happens in casual messaging with someone you just met. I always deflected when it felt too personal for our level of acquaintance, and I would just keep my answers short and non-descript, but polite. As he's a close friend of many of our closest friends, I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

&#x200B;

After some point, it finally hit that tipping point where I realized something else was going on here. He asked about my weekend plans and I said I was exhausted from work and just looking to take it easy. I'd been complaining about my job and made a dark joke about the sweet release of death, to which he responded, ""Well, maybe we should just run away together"" in earnest. Uh, what? 10 minutes later, in an attempt at glossing it over, he dropped a winking face with tongue emoji, as if to imply, in hindsight, that he had been joking. 

&#x200B;

I left the message on read (I know), but I didn't know how to respond. Should I drop it? Should I say something? I asked my boyfriend, who was disappointed to hear about our exchange because, of course, his comment, but also because he seemed like a cool guy. He gave me some harsher response suggestions, but I ultimately decided I just wanted to keep it real with this person in a polite way. A few days later, I replied to apologize for taking some time to respond and explained that it was because his comment made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I said I hope I wasn't reading into it, but I respected him enough to honest with him and hoped we could just let it be water under the bridge. He never read my message and (coincidentally?) got a new phone number. A week later he messaged from his new number as if nothing had happened. I did not respond.  

&#x200B;

This would have all been an awkward, unwanted exchange I could leave in the past if I didn't regularly see this person at social functions. We were at a close friend's birthday party last night and it was so awkward. I avoided him, circling around and catching up with other mutual friends, and he couldn't decide if he wanted to avoid me or address me and was generally just hovering around awkwardly. An additional element is that he has a great, super cool girlfriend who we also hit it off with. She came up and gave me a big hug and couldn't believe it had been so long since we'd seen each other. I complimented her necklace and she gushed, ""Oh, \[my boyfriend\] actually gave it to me for Christmas! It's great, right? He has pretty good taste."" So, in addition to all the awkwardness around finding a way to being true to myself and my feelings and being polite to this person in the presence of our mutual friends, I also am concerned for his girlfriend, who likely has no idea.

I don't feel like I can talk to my close friends about it, as they are close friends with him, but I don't know who else to talk to about it. I think the thing that makes it the most challenging for me is that the comment (and the increasingly frequent and personal chatting that preceded it) was very subtle and casual and could be easily misconstrued as a misunderstanding. I feel frustrated because I'm angry at this person for his inappropriate behavior and inability to address it, but also because it makes me doubt myself and my experience of what happened. This isn't the first time I've experienced this dynamic out in the world, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

133,"Honestly I just need to rant about some bs real quick. Stay with me here. It?s long, but be angry with me pls lmao because the place that I work for is ridiculous and has resulted in me declining a promotion.

So for over 15 months, I have worked as a server at this restaurant chain. I started my journey of employment there in January of 2018.

After six months of working there, the district manager (for future reference - because it will be important - this is how the food chain goes for us if you?re unfamiliar: Shift Manager, then Assistant Manager, then General Manager, then District Manager, then Vice President and then the Owner) told one of our Assistant Managers that he wanted me to receive a raise. This raise would mean that instead of making server wages (at less than $4 per hour) that I would make minimum wage ($9.25 per hour) with tips on top of that. The assistant manager that he told this to was a close friend of mine at the time and seemed excited for me; I soon learned that she was not as she never spread that information along, lied to me about meetings and promotion information and basically sabotaged my promotion to summarize. She?s a snake but that?s a story for another day.

I didn?t receive this raise until September after three months of questioning it. I was suffering financially (minimum wage is not living wage) and had so many unexpected expenses thrown on me all at once (I had one sick cat and another die resulting in almost $1K in vet bills, needed new lenses in my glasses, $800 worth of car repairs, a lot in medical expenses because I?ve been having some serious medical problems this year, birthdays, my dad had an unexpected surgery and I had to pay the bills while he was off for recovery, etc. the list honestly goes on and on) and really just needed something to work out for me. I had drained my savings to support myself and my family (while still only being 18) and was killing myself doing so.

I was given my raise in September and also told that I was being promoted to manager, which would mean $11 per hour. They wouldn?t give me a straight answer on when I was going to start training until November - during which I was told that I would start training in January.

Because I was still suffering financially, I started looking for a second job in December and started that second new job in January of 2019. I switched my hours from days to nights at the restaurant (which they were okay with) and started working 50-60+ hours per week between both jobs to catch up on bills.

I started training for management in February, only after I cornered the district manager himself and asked him about it. He?s a great guy himself, he?s very appreciative of me. Him and the VP both are. They?re just very busy and unfortunately don?t work in-store with me. But they?re stand-up guys nonetheless.

I trained for a solid month and a half until I had to switch day jobs again because my other one wasn?t giving me the hours that I needed. I took on a full time day time nanny job (which pays twice what either other job does/did) and had to change my shifts at the restaurant by an hour (instead of coming in at 5, I?d have to come in at 6 instead. This is an easy change, they do this for other staff members all of the time. It?s a regular shift for it to start at that time).

While telling my GM about this schedule change, I told him the reason for the change and explained how my other job had removed me off of the schedule almost completely (cutting me down to like 5 hours per week) with no notice and that that was why I had to quit. I couldn?t pay my bills.

And what do you know.. the following week he cuts my hours to 5 hours. And the week after. And the week after that.

I was livid. I know he did it intentionally because we don?t like each other (professionally we get along, but personally we do not. He?s a very condescending and self entitled person and when he speaks poorly to me, I call him out and tell him to either change his tone or stop speaking to me). He also doesn?t like that I have been labeled as ?teachers pet? to the district manager; he likes me a lot and wants to keep me as an employee and has yelled at our GM on my behalf, which my GM resents and has held against me despite it being his own fault. When I asked my district manager about being promoted (since it?s his call and the GM wouldn?t answer me when asked) instead of the GM finally, the GM said I went ?behind his back? and was ?upset about it?. If he did his job right, we wouldn?t be in this situation right now. It?s bs that his personal bias is affecting my job. He?s on thin ice with corporate right now for other reasons (complaints from other employees, selling expired products, etc.) too so it?s not just me either. I?d have no issue with him if he just did his job correctly. He did this to himself.

When asked why he cut my hours, he told me that it?s because - and I quote - that I have ?sh*t availability and have shown no desire to show more?. I have the same availability as virtually all of the other night shift workers. I also always stay later to do paperwork and documentation work that only managers do - which I am not paid to do yet, by the way! I am only making minimum wage! - and cover all shifts that need to be covered when asked.

I do my job right. Every. Single. Manager. There has told me that I?m their best employee, with the exception of the GM. I have multiple positive reviews from customers online and in person, glowing letters of recommendation (6 of them, to be exact) and have had customers physically pull my district manager and Vice President aside during a walk through to tell them how wonderful I am and that I deserve a raise. So many of my customers are like family to me now. I cried when one of them came to tell me that her husband had passed. I celebrate their successes with them and enjoy hearing about their day. I have worked my ass off to build important and meaningful relationships with them and the staff and have done my best to make this job count for something and it has showed. I won our yearly award for best employee. I have received rewards from corporate throughout the year for being one of the best ones there as well. I have literally had customers try to get me to come work with or for them instead of at this restaurant because they think I?m so wonderful.

But I have no desire to show more hours (I.e. make myself available to them 24/7) so I?m not worth the promotion? I haven?t been trained in nearly a month. I?m ignored or spoken to in a condescending manner when I try to learn anything new. It?s clear to me that I am not being treated the way that I deserve here. They have now shown any *desire* to give me any reason to stay. For Christ?s sake, they don?t pay me enough. Minimum wage is not enough to make me a slave to you, nice try though. I?ve also offered to relocate to a different store for training if it means more hours (which is done frequently) and they haven?t done that either.

So, I am turning in my two weeks notice. I still have my day job which isn?t enough long term, but it?s enough to pay my bills for now. I will find another second job that will be better than this one. I?ve already scheduled some interviews.

I also wrote an email to our district manager explaining why I felt that this job isn?t for me anymore and I?m going to send it as soon as my two weeks notice is in. He deserves to know why his ?favorite employee? is walking away. And why this promotion isn?t enough to put up with the bs that goes on there.

Then one day, I said I didn't want to do it today, I thought he understood, he said that that was okay. We were just kissing then he started to get a bit violent, he was grabbing me a lot harder, almost hurting me I guess. I knew it didn't feel right but I said nothing. What he did next is something I'll never forget, he grabbed my head and forced me on to him and forced me to, well I'm sure you can guess. We broke up not long after, he left me for some else. I was so broken, he just dropped me and then pretended like we never happened. Just left me whilst I was feeling so low. Later on, a few months the thought of what he did to me started to haunt me. Every night I go to bed and I remember what he did, I dream about him and what happened. Every day seeing him reminds me of what he did. Seeing how he doesn't have a care in the world about what he did and whats worse he knows what he did.

 I think what has also made it worse was the other day, I was walking near my school(during our week off) and I seen the bus he would get to school and it reminded me of him, I thought ""it would be funny if he just got off it"", I looked up from the ground and I seen him, I felt terrified, I'm not scared or threatened by him but just seeing him unexpectedly whilst I was alone brought everything back. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I just carried on walking and reliving ever moment again again.

He asked me why I made the appointment and I couldn't tell him, as I cant tell you.  It was a whim.  After imaging the backs of my eyes he becomes much more concerned than I'm comfortable with a doc checking me out being.  He shows me a topographical map of the inside of the back of my eye, and points out that the large, spike-esq structure jutting out is not supposed to be there.  That's my optic nerve, swollen as all hell, forced further into my eye by intracranial pressure.  That pressure is caused by either a concussion (of which I've had 0), genetics (its equally swollen in both eyes so incredibly unlikely), meningitis (dont have that) or a brain tumor.

I'm in my senior year of college and have very bad anxiety. I have a very hard time making friends. Even getting a text gives me anxiety.

I forced myself to go to a video game club meeting because I felt unhappy about not having friends. I stood in a bathroom with my stomach in knots considering not going, but I went anyway. I unexpectedly hit it off with a group of people. He was one of those people.

I forced myself to go to the video game club Halloween event. Him and I were one of the very few people to actually wear costumes. We had a lot of fun together but also had fun separated with other people. The 4 people who wore costumes took a group photo and he put his arm around me in the picture.

We slowly but surely spent more time together. We would play games together in the computer lab on campus. We went to the music store to ""try out"" their instruments (I play bass and violin, he plays drums and piano). One day, we had coffee and as we left and went to the parking lot, he asked me if I would consider going out with him.

I honestly thought we were becoming good friends up until that point and I had no idea he had feelings for me. But after he said, that my brain basically broke. I stuttered something incoherent and covered my blushing face. After that night, I thought about him in an entirely different light. We went on a small road trip to the beach with our friends and I cuddled his jacket the entire trip (apparently he didn't notice!) 

After more time of us spending time together as friends, he asked me if I would consider a relationship with him. I said yes, and he told me how he had never even kissed a girl before. We watched the movie 'Sorry to Bother You' in an internet cafe while awkwardly cuddling the entire time. 

When he took me back to my house, we kissed, and I instinctively slipped a bit of tongue (oops), he really liked it and it ended up in a makeout session in his car. 

Fast forward, we are in a serious relationship and I am very much in love. He makes me laugh so hard. I am unbelievably attracted to him... Every time I see the little gap in his front teeth I fall in love all over again. I have been able to completely be myself with this man. He is so genuine. I honestly feel like he is the love of my life. I would be very very happy if this was the person I married and spent my life with.

No matter what, they created this man who is so kind and has so many beautiful traits, who would do anything for the people he cares about.

 I don't know if I will ever actually meet them but I feel really nervous about what will happen when/if I do. I want to marry this man in the future but how will our wedding work out?

He became reliant on me more and more. I felt neglected more and more. The whole time I was back on meds and getting better and stronger. We had a lot of good times and we helped each other but I was definitely the more mature of us even though he was a few years older and it wore on me. I didn?t feel like a girlfriend anymore. I felt like his mom.


I didn?t like it. I didn?t like how I couldn?t rely on him for the things I needed. Like when I went with him for a weekend away and the day we were supposed to leave, I asked him multiple times to leave and he just kept asking me to wait until he was done with his fantasy football pick and kept drawing it out for hours. I broke down in the car after we left and he blamed his friends rather than taking responsibility. And we both have generalized anxiety, so you?d think he?d pick up on things like that.


The last straw though. He was in my house when on a different floor, my family and I were having a dysfunctional time and my brother threatened to hit me because I accused him of being a hypocrite (I reference his past history for violence). My bf heard me yell ?you threaten to hit me again, I?m going to call the police? but he stayed upstairs.


He said that he didn?t want to make the situation worse and I told him I understood...but on the inside, I no longer felt safe with him. My bf who is a black belt in aikido, who should have been able to easily subdue a single aggressor in a safe manner. I have about a hundred pounds vs my sibling who is almost six feet tall and I don?t know how many pounds. 


When he failed to stand by my side when I needed him the most, I don?t know, I just began to wonder why I was with him. Yeah he?s a good person inside and sweet and texts me and says all the right things. Yet, when I explain to him what I need in a relationship, it doesn?t click with him, he says he doesn?t understand because he doesn?t have experience with that kind of thing.


Eventually I got sick of explaining in different ways and trying to find a solution together. He simply didn?t get it. Situational or social awareness. He didn?t seem autistic in the least, just immature and childish.

The people I used to consider friends turned their back on me during my hardest semester, and though I'm sure it wasn't intentional, it made me realize how circumstantial a lot of my college friendships are.  I hate being alone, but I also either hate myself or everyone I know - so my life going into finals week is pretty shitry.

I work hard and will continue to do so despite my wavering self-confidence.  I'm not suicidal, but I am depressed - and have this overwhelming feeling of being trapped in my own skin.  I'm not sure what direction I should take my life to make me happier, but all I know is what I have been doing isn't working, and I need to make a change.

I?ve never told anyone this before.

I?m a F25 living by myself in a smalltown in Europe. Since I?ve been 13, i?ve been faking who I am online to get attention. 

Most of you probably think of the casual catfish luring people into relationships because they don?t like themselves. But that?s not true for me. I do like myself, to some limit. I don?t have problem finding partners and/or friends irl. Which makes what I do even more freaking weird.

It started when I was 13. The good old time with MSN. I don?t know why, but i lied to my irl friends about having friends that lived in in other towns. They showed interest in it, and I made a MSN accounts for them. Talked to my friends through these ?charachters?. I even kept my phone number to myself just so my friend could text with my made up friends at night. 

It escalated really quick. I made fake accounts on random sites and communities (often children sites, being 13-15 myself) claiming to be someone I wasn?t. It was always a guy. A guy I found attractive. People befriended me really quick and I stuck to it.

When I was 16, one IRL friend realized what was going on. She was closer to my ?character? than to me. And she told people the truth. I was hated in all communities. I?m not mad about this. I deserved it.

The weird thing is, you would think I would stop after this, right? Well, no. I just went to other communities. And the same thing happend over.. and over.. and over again.

Fast forward to today. Like I said, I?m 25. And I have 3 living ?chars? right now. I use different browsers to talk through them all on different discord servers. People think it?s different people. 1 Guy and 2 girls. Every day I have 3 browsers up + the discord app to communicate. As myself and my ?characters?.

I know what I?m doing is wrong. Because it?s wrong. But I?m so deep in this shit I can?t get out. And Frankly, I don?t feel like I need to. Which scares me the most.

I never believed in the ?i?m all alone in this world? bullshit. But this is honestly the one thing I feel like I?m alone doing. I don?t have DID. I don?t do it to hurt people. I don?t know what?s wrong with me. I feel like I?m just the biggest attention seeker ever. The more there are of me, the more attention I get. It doesn?t matter if it?s true or not.

I have this girl on my social media who went to high school with me and she suffers from a variety of health conditions with symptoms similar to mine. We weren?t close in HS but I have been talking to her for advice and confiding in her about how my chronic pain has taken over my life and I am only 22. She has always given me hacks for dealing with nausea, pain, and what type of tests to ask my doctors for since none of them take me seriously. 

She?s dealt her illness since she was a toddler, has a feeding tube and has even gone into cardiac arrest from malnutrition because of her condition. I always sympathize and when she was in the hospital, I sent flowers.. anonymously and have never told her. 

Recently, I made a post on my social media, giving praise to another person who has been dealt a shitty hand in life when it comes to health. This girl who is in medical school and has gone through several brain surgeries due to strokes. I found her so amazing and an inspiration.  This ?friend? sent me a private message to tell me how people with chronic illness and disabilities can do great things too. 

She proceeded to talk about how she finished her AA degree and was going to get a nursing degree next and nothing was going to stop her. She knows that I had to drop out of school and had to finish my degree online because I couldn?t cope with the pain, I had no treatment plan or diagnosis. She told me that I need to learn to deal with my pain better because she actually has an illness and she goes through life just fine. That made me feel so weak. 

I am already a bit sensitive because of the fact that I don?t have a diagnosis to explain how I have been feeling to others. It feels awkward talking to people who actually have worse conditions than me  and I am over here dropping out because of unexplained pain. I feel like she discredited my pain and symptoms, because hers were a lot worse. I acknowledge that and I have a lot praise for her even though she?s always gotten pity for having a feeding tube from others. I?ve never given her pity because I know she is strong. It just felt bad that she thinks of me like that.

**Edit 2:** For those who have been trapped and grew up with abuse and chronic trauma: Don't give up. Healing isn't linear. There are no mythical cures.

?The Body Keeps the Score? is the best book on trauma and cPTSD (complex PTSD - a variant due to developmental trauma) along with ?The drama of the Gifted Child?. If you read nothing else, these too should give you all you need. In modalities, a trauma-informed therapist, EMDR ([r/EMDR](https://www.reddit.com/r/EMDR)) and Neurofeedback ([r/Neurofeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/Neurofeedback)) are precious life-changing tools.

For those who called me an attention seeker: Stop invalidating people in need. I'm at a point in my life where I'm strong enough that such remarks have zero effect on me. But others who are still battling to find courage to reach out might read this post. They might be in a crucial and vulnerable turning point in their lives. They might find courage to seek help, right up to a point where someone just has to invalidate them as such. Those comments make them AFRAID to be invalidated again, to be called a liar again. They are afraid to be told to suck it up again. It silences victims seeking help because they fear to be just that: attention seekers, not people in real need. But they are people in need. People who suffered chronic trauma NEED HELP, compassion, empathy, acceptance. Not ridicule, further invalidation or judgement.

I stopped caring about myself. I stopped caring about seeing anyone. I just locked myself in the room and kept quiet about my emotions. 

People checked up on me but I didn?t want to respond.

I thought about all the times he would around so happy and energetic when I would want to play with him with the toy.

This small glimpse made me realize something, I kept focusing on the end of his life, I never took pictures of him when he was younger, so I never really had a direct path to those memories. It opened my eyes entirely and I think that shred of happiness I felt was enough to start the path of crawling out of this hole of depression.

But basically, my bestie and I were talking about going to see Endgame together along with my roommate the other day. Then, on the premier night, apparently the two of them went to see it and didn't invite me. She did tell me that we would go see it together in a couple of days but for some reason I'm extraordinarily upset by not being there with her during her first viewing.

Her logic on going was that she did plan on going to the midnight premier (11 PM is when they went due to it coming out earlier than Midnight) and that I stated I had to work early the next day and wouldn't want to do a midnight. Except what I said was that I would have to think about it if we went late because of work. Plus my roommate worked way earlier than me and still went. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to go which I really would have loved to do. I was sad about not being able to earlier in the day. Originally we actually were going to go on the premier night together but our roommate didn't realize what day it was and meant to plan for Sunday. So we were going to all go on Sunday instead.

It started off a beautiful June day. It was my grandfathers 80th birthday. My wife and our 2 daughters were getting in the car and my step father was mowing our lawn. We wave he smiles and waves back. We lived 3 houses apart from each other. So he would come mow our yard because landscaping was a passion of his.

We have an amazing time at the party its sunshine and a cool 80 degrees outside. We pack up say good bye to everybody my wife is yelling for me but I keep talking for a very long time. I just got caught up in conversation. 20 mins later we leave. 

She says I?ve been trying to leave for 30 mins. I smile and say lets grab a coffee. She smiles and agrees. We get coffee and head home. The sky is black rain and hail pour out of no where. Please believe every word I say because from here on out it sounds like a fictional thriller screenplay.

The storm lasts 3 mins. Now there is a double rainbow my wife and kids are in awe. Im thinking how odd for this to come and go so fast. We make it to our street. I say to my wife ?lets go see daryl and mom say thanks for mowing the yard.? As were nearing our house I see flashing lights in the distance. We live on a bend. I tell my wife to stop home so I can grab something  real quick. She says no somethings wrong. Im like just stop I gotta run in she says NO somethings wrong. 

We pull around the bend everything?s in slow motion I see a parked car on the side of the road. In the distance I see a ambulance then I see police cars. I look to my right I see daryl my step fathers motorcycle standing up in the middle of a field. I look down to the ground I see daryl face first in the ditch..... I gasp and scream DARYL my kids immediately scream my wife screams. Daryl is my second dad he?s been in my life for 24 years I?m 30 he?s my kids grandfather. 

We pull into the drive way my mom is inside sleeping off midnights. My kids run inside to tell her. My wife is like a chicken with her head cut off screaming and crying running from person to person. Everything is still in slow motion to me I walk over to the scene, the ambulance is just getting to him. The trooper says something to me I cant make it out but i know he?s trying to stop me from going over. I squeeze past him I get to daryl the paramedics roll him over, I see them reach in his groin for a pulse she shakes her head and they put a tarp over his body. I know immediately.

My mom wakes up she wont come off the porch shes passing out she knows He?s gone. One of the most haunting memories is her screaming whats he need? He needs my mom she says ?mooommmm help him please mom? her mom has been gone for 10 years. She passes back out. We all head to the hospital nobody knows he?s actually gone except me.

We arrive they pronounce him dead now we all head back home to grieve. Now all I?m thinking is how??? And why was his bike standing up in the middle of the field, if I was there before any medic or police actually made it to the scene then how could his bike be on the stand. Then I remember the one car parked it dawns they were the ones to call it in. 2 days go by were all at moms grieving together. This is where everything turns insane.

2 vehicles pull in front of my moms house and they are just parked in the road for 20 mins talking to each other. Im starting to get upset because this is very rude. The truck pulls off the suv pulls in to the drive way I see strangers get out and start walking towards me. Light bulb goes off, its the people who called the accident in. They come to the door and say can we talk to your mom we are the ones who found daryl. I say of course come in. She walks past and her boyfriend is next I lock eyes and I know him!! He?s a RAGING ALCOHOLIC!! The last time I saw him he threw another guy on the back of his motorcycle shit faced at 1am to go to the bar before it closes.

The first thing out of his mouth was ?We were heading to the store to get beer and we came across him? as he?s looking at the ground. Immediately I have the worst vibes I have ever felt in my life. I cant believe he just said that. They sit down and my mom thanks them gives her a hug. Conversation starts.

The woman starts asking questions immediately what was daryl doing? Was he a drinker? Did he drink that day? What did the police say? Wheres the motorcycle? Did the cops say how he crashed? She even goes to say when they pulled up they walked out to check on him and it looked like he was mad and threw his helmet and gloves!!! WTF!! She SAYS WE SAW HIM TAKE HIS LAST BREATH. As this woman is spewing her garbage I get a phone call from Daryl?s son he tells me daryl died on impact. So all this shit she is saying doesn?t even make any sense. Turns out they walked out in the field and PICKED DARYLS BIKE UP AND PUT IT ON ITS KICKSTAND!! Tampering with a accident scene grounds enough to at least be questioned about. My mom doesn?t pick up on anything. I?m just giving her the death stare because I know there lying and full of shit. She does ask one perfect question. Who were you guys talking to outside for awhile before you came in? ?Oh thats my friend James xxxxx?

Turns out I know that guy through another friend. He?s a dirtbag in and out of prison has 8 kids smokes weed while there on his lap real winner. Im thinking why the hell of all places would you guys see each other on this country road and converse for 20 mins in front of the family?s house of the man you just found dead. Fucking weird!!

I tell my mom I think they had something to do with the accident she starts crying and it all comes to her. Shes knows they were saying and asking weird shit. She just thought they were weird. When I tell her the autopsy says daryl died on impact she realizes that woman?s crazy. I need to get out of the house so I call a good buddy to pick me up and go for a ride and tell him everything.

He picks me up I tell him everything. I tell him how I found daryl and that these people showed up had a weird ass story yadda yadda. Then I go oh yea and they stopped in front of my moms and talked to James xxxxx for 20 mins before they even came in. He slams the breaks pulls the car over looks at me with tears in his eyes and says James was there today talking to the people who called Daryl?s accident in? I said ya. My friend says I saw James the evening of the accident he came to my house and asked if that was my step dad that died in the crash. He goes on to tell him he was there at the scene driving by and saw the body. My friend says dude why didn?t you stop and help. He said there was already cops there and somebody parked. He?s  full of shit I was the first one there after they found daryl the cops and ambulance pulled up 30 secs after I did. They immediately blocked the road off so no way he came after I did. That means he was there with the people who called it in and left the scene and they stayed. My head swells and I cant breath as it all comes together.

They are all friends and were going to a graduation party. They were either drunk or speeding and ran my dad off the road around the sharp bend in between our houses. He lost control and ran into a fence post and collapsed his aorta less then 100? from his drive way. They took my moms husband my daughters best friend. They took a piece of all of us and they tampered with the scene, they stood the bike up they touched everything. They came the next day to my moms to get their story straight and find out what the cops know.

I call the cops tell them all of this and they send ONE cop to talk to me. He agrees this is crazy and he will find out whats going on. He calls me back the next day and says there all lying about everything. He says some of them say they know each other, some say they don?t, some say there friends and some say they never heard of each other. The cop tells me they have them on multiple lies and next stage is to bring them down for questioning he says were on to something big and he will call me the second he knows anything. The cop talked to James and he admits to driving by the scene. Were all feeling a little bit better. 

Days go by no call. I call the officer he never answers me. I leave messages nothing. Days turn to weeks. Weeks turn to months. I call and the only officer who was working my case was now transferred and theres a new investigator taking over the case. He calls my mom and says the cause of the accident is a inexperienced motorcyclist and the case is closed...... 

This June 24th will be 2 years since daryl died 100ft away from his driveway. The last time we saw him he waved smiled and mowed my yard. I think about the accident every day and I?m sure I should be in some kind of therapy. I think what if non stop, what if I woulda left the party when my wife wanted to. What if i woulda thanked him that 2 sec diff could of changed everything. My mom needs therapy for sure. She is not moving on or letting anything go she is in pain everyday. So are my wife and kids and I have to see these people around town knowing what they did. Sorry to bring anybody down I just need to get this out and off my chest. Maybe they didn?t do anything but in my heart of hearts I know they did something and got away with it all. RIP Daryl.

It can be very difficult to see what is coming because of all of the trees and foliage. As I come around this curve I spot a woman and her two children frantically waving their arms while standing in front of a car with the hazard lights on. They caught my full attention. I passed by them wondering what kind of help they need, and then I hear this very loud pop. It sounded and felt like I ran over a soccer ball. I come to a dead stop and look in my rear view mirror. It looked like someone took a watermelon and smashed it on the ground. It was a turtle trying to cross the road. The mother and children were frantic. I was frantic.

For the past two weeks my uncle, 62 years of age, has been incredibly sad, quiet, and irritable. My aunt said he?d come home in tears one day. This is highly unusual as he?s normally the sweetest, happiest, most energetic person in our extended family. We all kept asking what was wrong, but he just blew us off with ?oh it?s nothing, just the weather?. Finally, yesterday, he revealed to my aunt what had happened, and she passed the story to us.

Seems he?d gone into a coffee shop where a ?young women?, as he put it, was working: so likely a teenager or early 20?s. As he paid for his coffee he told the young women that she was very pretty. He?s not at all sleazy, he just genuinely likes making people happy. As he began walking out of the shop the women went around the corner to her friends. She?d assumed he was gone, but my uncle overheard her say something like ?ewwww, this creepy old bald guy just hit on me! God what a creep. I hope he doesn?t come back to rape me!? Then they all started laughing. My uncle said he quickly left the shop, dropping the coffee on the floor on the way out. 

I know he?ll bounce back from this, but to me this women?s words and actions are unfathomable.  I see this type of behavior in other instances too, specifically the phrase ?creepy old guy?. Yes, there ARE legitimately creepy men, HOWEVER, the standard by which most ?creepiness? is gauged seems to be age and baldness. I?ve seen many social media posts about this, heard girls use the term for when an ?older guy? hit on them. You even see it in sitcoms and movies. There?s always the joke about the ?creepy old guy? from the bar who tried to buy me a drink *laugh track*. 

Why is this accepted? If men should treat women with respect and kindness (and they should), why aren?t men given the same consideration? Is it because men don?t have feelings, and should be able to handle it? Can you imagine an instance where a 62 year old women told a young man he was handsome, and he went on to tell his friends ?ewww, this creepy old hag hit on me. She probably wants my dick!?

178,"I feel how I did when I was a kid: in my own head and on my own. I spent a year and a half liking one girl. I never knew if she liked me back. I didn't make any moves. Next thing I know she falls head over heels for a guy she met less than a week ago on a school trip in late March. As of today, they're officially dating. I don't know what I did wrong, if anything. We used to have such a good time together, I'd make her laugh, she'd make me laugh, staring at each other, stuff like that. All that changed last week. Over the trip in March I'd asked her to prom to see if she had some semblance of affection for me, but almost immediately after the promposal she said she felt nauseous and went inside. I went to take a shower, and when I came out, I found her and her soon to be boyfriend talking in the hotel room. She left once I got out to take her shower in her hotel room. At this point I had already come to the realization that she probably didn't like me, because she had ignored me and even her best friend for him after the second day of the trip for the most part. If she could talk to anyone, she'd always choose him. Fast forward to last week with prom that Saturday. Our practice ended, and I was talking to her afterwards. I knew from the start something was up, because she never hung around long, and she said she was waiting for a friend. I guessed one of her girl friends, and she said yes, but I knew she was lying. I leave and as I'm getting in my car to pull out of the parking lot, I see him walking to the pavilion. Of course it's him. Over the next few days she's always talking to him after school, which is what we'd normally do. She also said one day as we were talking that she had to go home, but all she did was walk 20 feet over to him to talk. At this point I decided to tell her I wanted to cancel my promposal and we could go separately, and ever since prom night we haven't spoken. It's been a week of no words, and I sit next to her in class. I just don't know if I did something wrong, wasted my time, misinterpreted anything, or was just never a thought in her head. And I just can't understand how someone she didn't know up until the trip became her only interest so quickly. She had never dated, he had never dated, and I have never dated. We were on a pretty level playing field, but she chose him. On the bright side, even though this situation sucks, I have actually been happy throughout it because for the first time in years I've actually been consistently happy. That happiness came from her, and being in pursuit of someone. Up until her I hadn't liked anyone really, but she struck something in me. Throughout my time with her I learned to overcome my anxiety, and actually enjoy myself because I could connect with someone who wasn't one of my guy friends. There was hope, and I guess the reason I didn't make any moves was because I was addicted to the feeling of a possible love that I didn't want to be shattered.

I lost my very best friend because I couldn't take how abusive he was. Speaking out against him, he'd rally everyone around him to back him up, when he was the one causing harm in the first place. I got scared to even disagree with him; so I stopped talking about what bothered me. I know this happened in childhood but I vividly remember it; we disagreed on something and he struck me as hard as he could in the back. There was a bruise on my back for weeks, and I never showed my parents. Never.

I remembered that, and it trained me to never tell him how I felt. Once you've been hit by someone, or at least in my case, you never trust them again.

192,"I have a lot to unpack. 

I spent the last 10 years building up a profile and portfolio to join the industry as a level designer. I went through various universities, moved into a new city *twice*, got a bachelor, a post graduate specialized diploma (basically a master) to get as much tools and knowledge as I could to offer a very complete and convincing profile.

I went through numerous extreme stressful situations, including battling a depression midway, but the thought of joining the industry was keeping me afloat. I always tried to outdo myself and do everything in my power to be on point and deliver quality work and god knows how many obstacles I've met on my path.

Last year was among the most important year of my journey since it was a school directly in contact and handled by the industry. I loved every moment of it, from the students, the teachers, the courses, the homeworks, it was an incredible and fun experience and I felt at my place. The last three months of that school year is focused on doing a full-scale production of 30 people of a video game. Turns out people trusted me enough to put me in charge of being an assistant lead game designer for the game (they voted for it and I was offered in return). Not only that but as we started production we got a mail from one of our teacher who worked directly at one of my city's big studio: they wanted to hire three junior level designers.

 Not only that but the description of the ideal candidate was exactly on point with mine, students at school even assumed I was a guaranteed bet because of that. And I also had a mentor/friend who was a senior there directly as an inside contact to push my profile forward.

Everything was going fine and I was on cloud 9.

Nope.

The studio in question decided to go for three candidates that not only hardly had any experience but didn't have any portfolio. One of them actually rushed a quick project *the weekend before his interview*, a person who is extremely friendly but never really did any convincing level designer work at school imo. All three of them got the job instantly.

My profile was ignored. It was very painful... Because I felt all my work was for nothing or that I wasn't taken because there was something problematic with my profile. It must be. I tried to stay optimistic. Because nothing happens for a reason right? 

A few weeks later, an indie studio I worked for 9 months as a level artist was looking for a junior level designer. A studio I loved. Maybe now was my time? They asked me to do a level design/level art test... with the assets I already used when I worked for them (????), so I went through the whole hiring process again (????) only to see a graduate in cinema get the job as a junior level designer, without any experience. Great, another stab in the stomach. 

... And then at the same time, another subdivision of the aforementioned big studio but in another city started to hire level designers. I applied. I got an answer in three days. They said they had good feedbacks from the school (then why you ignored my profile at the very beginning?) and made me go through an exhaustive (but fun) test. Did it, had an interview. It was probably the best interview in my life, lasted 1h20 at least. I wasn't stressed, no question blocked me, I was able to give complete constructive answers to everything, even make them laugh. I was ready to move to a different city and leave all my 6 years friend/life behind *for them*. But it wasn't enough, *again*.

I was called the next week by a human resource person that **wasn't even present during my interview**. He said that apparently ""they felt my answers about the role of a level designer were too vague and preferred to not pursue"". My insider contact did his researches and it turns out I didn't have enough experience despite having as much as another person who was hired recently for the same role.  Either way I was told bullshit and I was denied despite having what was needed overall, if not more than many people who get hired there.

And that was the last time I was given an opportunity for an interview. That was October 2018.

I kept sending applications after applications, I'm reaching the 40th one, but I'm constantly ignored. My profile hasn't progressed or evolved since and I'm out of options. I see job offers (from studio I already applied thrice in the last year) that correspond to things I can perfectly do but that's never enough, not to attract the attention of HRs. I see people around me with less experience and less difficulty gets opportunities. I see people with more skills than me struggle. 

And that's how it is. And  **it sucks hard**. I don't feel like effort and skills are rewarded. I sure as hell don't feel like all I've done is being recognized or acknowledged. I feel like I spent all these efforts for an industry that give jobs to people who are at the right place at the right time, or did the right smiles, or knew the right person, but nothing really beyond these spheres.

I'm mad and angry all the time, and now depressed again, because my motivation is crushed. I went on this journey *to be* part of the industry, not to *hope to be*. I could still be trying in one year, if not more, and still  be left out.

I deserved the first opportunity in that big studio, I *should have had it*. But I've been ignored, lied to, and I still don't know today why.

I'm constantly scared, anxious, terrified that I'm just one of these person that will never make it, despite all I've done, and I just want to scream at them but I can't... And I'm so mad and exhausted and it's taking so long to get something that I'm out of juice. I'm not even sure I would be happy to have an opportunity tomorrow because of how much of a hassle it all turned out to be.

And I'm expected to stay optimistic and do personal projects on my side while I get a temporary boring job with the hope that... *maybe*, a big *maybe* life will change for the better and I'm going to be recognized? That's not the life I worked for, nor the life I want... And with my currently fragile mind I'm not sure I would handle this in the long run.

 If I wasn't able to get a free job when I had contacts, the highest grades in the school's history, a complete and diverse portfolio, recommendations, skills, how am I supposed to assume I can someday make it the normal and tough way?

193,"So let's go back a few months. Around Christmas and New Years, my brother J proposed to his girlfriend JH for two years, bought a husky puppy together, and made a plan to move out of their apartments into a rented house in a state over from mine until they get married. Recently, my mom had the idea to have me move in with them and be able to spend time with them while helping them take care of the dog. They talked together and then talked to me about it. At the time, I thought it was good too and I agreed to it, but the more I thought about it, the less excited I got to go onto the trip. Now I'm here with them and I think I'm regretting my decision, but I don't know what to do. On one hand, the dog's pretty much all by himself almost everyday (because J didn't get the help he was promised), but on the other, I feel depressed and alone being without my cat who was a Christmas gift from J years ago after losing another one. I could have mom bring the cat down with her when she helps up move, but 1. JH has pretty bad pet allergies and can barely stand the dog inside, and 2. the trip takes up to 10 hours and the cat hasn't ridden in a car ever since he first came home with me.

194,"I posted this two years ago. I have been thinking about this for a while. A bunch of people asked if I was/suggested that this shows that I am a natural submissive. I have finally admitted to myself that I am. I don't practice anything of the sort (and am not interested in doing so) but I definitely am. Anyways, here is the story. I want to get it off my chest again.

""May I please bring you your coffee, Mr. Kravitz, Sir?""

I could see the form of a smirk on his bearded face. He leaned back and nodded, before going back to grading his papers. I eagerly ran off to the faculty break room and set the coffee before him.

He then looked up at me and gave me a file.

""Go place these in all of the social studies faculty mailboxes."" He then leaned back in his big chair, one leg folded over the other. ""I have to say. It's such a wonderful turn of events to see you... listening... to me so carefully.""

My heart pounded. I had such a giant energy taken over my body. I was serving and pleasing Mr. Kravitz, and it was all I wanted to do.

This was a very unlikely turn of events. I was a senior in high school. (It was the mid-90s). I was an underachieving, free-spirited class clown. I was not a bad kid -- too nerdy for that, even though I was really into punk music and hung out with skaters. But I was very sarcastic. I also knew how smart I was and had a certain arrogance about myself, despite my crappy grades.

Mr. Kravitz was my political science teacher, as well as the chair of the social studies department. He was exactly what you would think from an administrator. Cold. Unfeeling. Strict. By the book. I went to a public school without any real dress code. Mr. Kravitz was the only teacher who wore a suit. He was exactly everything I mocked and made fun of.

Even though I am absolutely not anymore, at the time I fancied myself a Young Republican. Mr. Kravitz, despite appearances, was a staunch Democrat and a huge Bill Clinton fan. I was very outspoken in class anytime we debated. He was not afraid to express his opinions. I wasn't, either. And I was also obnoxious enough to cut into him, interrupt, etc. (As I did with plenty of other teachers.) Our debates were NOT friendly at all. At one point he said that there was nothing he wanted more than to turn me into a liberal.

I also did not do a lot of homework -- for any teacher. For his class, we had a weekly assignment. We had to find a political news story and write 2-3 pages on its importance and tie it back into class. ""Mr. X. I see you haven't done your assignment. Again."" I said something back to him along the lines of, ""I don't waste my time on nonsense"" incredibly rudely.

The next day, I was told to go to the guidance office. Mr. Kravitz was there, stern looking. So was my guidance counselor. And my mom (my parents were really involved in my life) was on a speaker phone. He told her what I said. She was incredibly upset. And my punishment for my remarks? Every day for a week, I was going to report to Mr. Kravitz's office after class and ""help"" him as his assistant. My mom agreed to that.

I was really mad the first day I entered his office. His back was to me, even though he knew I arrived. He spun to me. ""Ah. I see that you at least know how to arrive on time. I'd like a glass of water. Be quick. No talking to your friends. I expect you back in three minutes.""

It was these sorts of trivial, mundane tasks and errands. I got him his coffee. I filed. I stapled. I cleaned his desk. Or I'd have to stand by patiently as he talked to another teacher or the like. If I looked away or slouched, he'd snap at me to pay attention while I waited. Mostly, it was silence. But sometimes he would say something to me about how I wasn't living up to my potential, I wasn't as unique as I thought I was, etc.

Finally, a few days into the punishment, he had me place a few files on his desk. I was across from him. He stood up and put on his suit jacket. ""You are really too big for your britches and you really need to be humbled. I hope you realize this and are coming to terms with it.""

He got up and walked past me, paying me no mind. But as he breezed past me, there was this wave of energy that overcame me. I had never felt more alive or awake. And my brain said something that it never said before.

""You must obey Mr. Kravitz."" I just felt this... purpose. That the only purpose in my life was to please him. My heart was pounding. I had this weird anxious feeling. This thought took over my life.

Those weekly assignments we had were 2-3 pages. They could even be handwritten since not everyone had a home computer yet. The next time I had the assignment, I wrote about 10 pages. The margins were perfect. I placed it into a plastic binder. I had such a huge rush while I was writing and preparing it.

I had such an excitement and sense of dread as class began. He called each of us one-by-one to hand in our assignments. I gulped as I stood up and gave it to him. He wasn't looking but I could tell he was shocked to feel the plastic in his hands, along with the few extra pages, along with my name being attached. Then he saw it and had a crooked, smug smile.

""Well, well, well. Will you look at this? Learning your lesson, I see."" He held it up and looked at it with this sarcastic face that he was ""impressed."" He pretended to read it. ""So many pages."" A bunch of my classmates were chuckling at me and my work. Not even the lamest honors students turned in anything that overboard.

All of my assignments for his class were turned in along those lines. I just had such a heightened energy anytime I did work for his class and just this excitement when I would see the glint in his eyes knowing that I was doing the work as he intended. (And I had great grades on them, too.)

And then, the next day, I knew there was something else I needed to do.

School ended. I waited a few minutes for the buzz of the day to end. Mr. Kravitz was behind his desk, going over some work. I knocked on the door. He looked up and and offered me a hello. After a few seconds of small talk, I told him why I was there. I stood before him, with my hands folded.

""Mr. Kravitz, Sir. I came to ask if you needed an assistant.""

He chuckled a bit and then sat back in his chair again, peering over his glasses at me. I was shaking almost.

""And why is that?"" He had this inflection not just of curiosity. But he wanted to make me say it.

""Ever since that week, I've been doing so much better in school."" I paused. I took a deep breath. ""You were right. I needed to be humbled, Mr. Kravitz, Sir.""

He just stared for a second and then had a wicked grin and then a laugh. He agreed and nodded.

And that's when I asked if I could fetch him his coffee.

A few weeks went by. I dutifully completed all of his assignments. And I arrived at his office promptly after school. I brought him his coffee. His water. I did all of his filing and copying requests. Sorting. My classmates were either in a club or goofing off while I was busy asking a custodian for baby wipes so I could wipe off his desk for him.

The day ended the same. It would be close to 4. He would announce it was time to leave. I would get his briefcase for him. I would have sorted out what he needed for the night -- papers to be graded and the like -- and have them properly filed. I would then carry his briefcase for him, walk behind him, hold the door open for him, and carry his briefcase to his car for him. I learned to laugh at his corny jokes.

My assignments continued to be delivered as I had met them. In class, I stayed quiet. I stayed away from much of the debates in class and absolutely did not challenge Mr. Kravitz.

Finally, near the end of the school year, we had some debate about health care policy. As it worked in this class, he usually sat in the back while we would take turns to address the class. I raised my hand high in the air -- like I would in the beginning of the year to usually undermine him.

I got up and walked to the front of the room. Time felt like it stopped.

""Health care is a right. It is something the government should provide for its citizens, like they do in Scandanavia.""

I saw him trying not to crack a smile. ""This is a surprise from you,"" he said.

That feeling I had was so strong. I just turned by back on my beliefs in front of the entire class.

""Well, Mr. Kravitz, Sir. You convinced me."" I gulped. ""You turned me into a liberal.""

There were a few snickers in the classroom (I doubt anyone really cared, though). He said something very middle-of-the-road about the importance of keeping an open mind. There was no gloating or anything in front of the room.

But I went to this office. He was sitting behind the desk waiting for me. He had his hands steepled and had a kingly posture.

""Is it true? Did I make you see the err of your ways?""

I paused. I took a deep breath.

""Yes, Mr. Kravitz, Sir. You made me a liberal. You are by far the best teacher I have ever had in my life. You will be the best teacher I will ever have in my life. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me, Mr. Kravitz, Sir.""

He had this gigantic smirk. In the moment, I realized that I was bent completely to his will. He knew it, too.

""I wanted you to learn to respect authority. To respect my authority. Like I said. You needed to be humbled. You learned your lesson quite well."" He paused. ""Could you please go and bring me a Coke from the vending machine upstairs and an everything bagel from the break room with some cream cheese?""

I was sexually assaulted 7ish years ago. I just turned 29 on Easter. 

The emotions I never processed flooded back to me about a month ago. I got distracted because I had to move houses but now I'm back to feeling my feelings about it.

I'm upset. I've googled for support groups where I'm located (a pretty big city, lots of addiction resources) and just -- nothin. I went thru substance abuse recovery here and they have a bajillion meetings a day.

Fuck you for being confusing 

What else?
I was told not to minimize the trauma, but I can't help it. It didnt destroy my life, or maybe it did. I went thru hell these last 2 years and could blame you, but what the fuck good would that actually do? Give you more power?

I get creative. I write a lot. I talk a lot too. I should make a shirt that says ""ASK ME ABOUT MY SEXUAL ASSAULT, IT HELPS ME HEAL""

Today, my manager called me before my shift, and said he was calling the other employees and telling them to work some on customer engagement, which is what I had worked on while I was working. Some of the examples of what we should say was ""How are you today"" and ""Have you tried \[company name\] before?"" I decided to try the first one. While I was giving out some smoothie samples, I was asking people ""How are you today?"" but apparently I'm not allowed to ask that without being rudely told ""No thanks."" in an extremely rude statement without an answer even to my question. Guys, we're all humans here and we should be able to treat each other politely. Maybe next time, you could engage in a conversation with these people instead of pushing them away. It would be nice to actually be able to talk to someone and have a nice conversation without people thinking that I'm going to *offer* them something, I know when people want to try a sample and when they don't. You could even say ""no thanks"" and still talk. It's okay to not want a sample, just don't be rude about it.",0,1556332388.0,bhulvv,2,offmychest

And the worst part? I'd have forgiven him. I wouldn't have even cared if he was just fucking honest with me. The outright lies and denial despite the proof hurt me more than any infidelity. Because the ratio of hurt and pain was nothing to how special he made the past six years and what he's done by encouraging me to get to therapy.

207,"Brief story- Alcoholism and drug addiction runs in both my mom and my dads side of the family, I am currently 21, and I have been addicted to drugs since I was 18. I am aware that if I am asking whether or not I am on the road to alcoholism, more likely than not, I am, but I just need to vent. I used to hate alcohol due to the hangover and the disgusting after effects I would receive, BUT I love the confidence it gives me and how it allows me to open up to everyone in ways I cannot currently do when I am sober (though I do intend to work on that). I have taken pretty much every major drug at least once (heroin, coke, meth, benzos, and a shit load of psychedelics and other rcs that I cannot recall) but my true love was always benzos, specifically Xanax. I suffer from crippling anxiety which leaves me feeling like an alien around other people and I rarely even leave my house (aside from work and hanging out with my amazing, loving, and most importantly, sober girlfriend) which probably doesn't help either. The few times I do go out for recreational purposes, i almost always have to consume drugs of some sort and I have only been sober for maybe less than 2 weeks ever since January 1st of this year (though, most of it has been Marijuana along with the rare prescription pills). Lately (especially this past week and a half) I have been drinking almost every single night (after work), which is something I would have never done, even 6 months ago, but since I am trying to maintain this image of a new ""sober"" me, I have resorted to alcohol because it is socially acceptable, I live with my family, and most importantly, it gives me that cocky and confident attitude that benzos give me (with the only difference being that my sleep is poor and I get shitty hangovers). This past week, I have been drinking on an almost compulsive level, even when i'm working (i'll go sneak a couple beers in while on lunch..) and honestly, I feel disgusted with myself. I can feel myself slipping back to my old ways and even now, as I speak, I am on nearly 100mg of Ritalin and half a fifth of alcohol into my night, by myself. I cannot afford rehab right now because I am only 1 year away from graduating college and I have no desire to go back to rehab (I have gone nearly a dozen times already). What kills me the most is that I come from a relatively upper-middle class family that is also very supportive of me, I have zero debt, and I have a girlfriend who has stuck by my side for almost 2 years even though I have been high for half of our relationship. I know I am ranting, but I just needed to vent about this to someone, anyone really, I know I have it in me to quit, but I hate who I am while I am sober. If your reading this and have confidence/mental health issues, take this as a warning to not get into drugs (this includes alcohol too because it is also a drug and I hate how it isn't considered one) as they only lead to one of  three endings, either death, prison, or eventually becoming sober and trying to fix the ruin you will inevitably leave behind in your life due to your addiction.",0,1556332246.0,bhul74,2,offmychest

212,"So everything started going downhill 2 years ago when my dad died of leukemia. He was admitted to the hospital literally a month before university started. 

I had to leave for university after 3 weeks, because I needed a week to get acquainted and because my university is overseas. During that week, I started getting intense flashes of fear, thinking about whether my dad would die. I would call my parents every day, wanting to be with my dad but trusting that he would survive and be alright. 5 days into the first week my mom started saying that my dad couldn't come to he phone because chemo made him tired, but she'd put my on speaker so my dad could hear me.

2 days before he died, my mother called me in the middle of the night, hysterical and in tears, telling me I had to come back immediately. I hopped on the next available flight. My dad had suffered a massive intracranial bleed, and had to be intubated just so he could breathe. He was so badly paralysed that the only thing he would do was grind his teeth and jerk the right side of his body. He couldn't seem to close his eyes. He was so badly bloated. I couldn't believe that he was actually my lively, active dad. When I left the room the first time, I remember thinking ""that man is not my dad"".

The doctors said they'd given him multiple bags of platelets but his numbers weren't rising. They couldn't wheel him in for an MRI to see how bad the stroke was because he needed the breathing apparatuses. I was in denial. I wanted my dad to be okay. My dad died 9 days into my first semester of university. I was in the ICU at his bedside and watched as the numbers on his screen fell. I felt so helpless. 

I went back to university about a week or two after his funeral. I began experiencing intense flashbacks to the ICU at any point in my day. My tutor in a workshop played a video of a baby with whooping cough, and the sound of the ""lack of O2"" alarm made my stomach drop. The flashbacks faded in time, but I began experiencing heart palpitations and the distinct sense that my heart was skipping beats. I went to the university doctor and she got me an EKG, but I was fine, thankfully. That was first year. 

Second year was fine, but I was so angry and unhappy all the time. My relationship with my mom has been weirdly distant yet affectionate for a long time. I think I've been holding a grudge against her, because she will only initiate a call to me once in a blue moon, and sometimes when I text her asking if I can call her, she leaves me on read and never responds until the next time I text asking if I can call. I've told her that it would be nice if she could respond to my texts, when if it's hours after she's read it, like ""oh sorry I didn't respond because I was suddenly busy and I forgot"", but it never happens. I think sometime in the last year I got worried that she's annoyed that I want to talk so much. 

Which brings us to now, my third year. I'm losing it. I've been feeling lost and kind of empty. I'm losing the motivation to leave my room, but thankfully I'm still keeping up with personal hygiene. I force myself to go to the library to study, but I'm getting tired easily. The entire day I'm just tired, even if I've had coffee. I should go see a doctor, huh.

Easter Sunday I had a strange, fearful and intense feeling that swept through my body when I woke up to use the bathroom, and lay down to go back to sleep, and I suddenly had a strange fear that I was having a heart attack, even though I didn't have any symptoms at all. Is this a panic attack?? 

That brings us to today. It's 6.25 am. I've been awake the entire night. I keep getting that panicky, terrifying feeling that my heart has stopped, every time I'm just about to drop off to sleep. That's if I can even get to that point. My body is exhausted, but I can't get my mind to stop. I've been awake the entire night. I went for a 20 minute walk at 4.30am. I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I tried going back to sleep just now, but I got that panicky feeling again when I was just about to fall asleep. I'm sitting on the floor, away from my bed right now. I don't want to associate my bed with that panic.

We'd be rowdy in class, throw stuff at other people, hit on hot babes, pick on the shy or quiet kids by calling them mean nicknames, steal people's lunches, you name it. Sometimes it lead to a fight, most of the time it didn't. Me and my friends were on the baseball team so we thought we were the untouchable hot shots since we won the championship for our school three years in a row. That's pretty much how things went.

And I honestly didn't even come from a bad family. I came from a wealthy one actually. Neither of my parents abused me and I lived in a good neighborhood. I just had this cocky disposition that just became a part of me starting in probably middle school. But I didn't really think I was getting to anyone. It was just pure asshole-ness fun, in my opinion. That was until I found out some kid tried to hang himself in my senior year because one of my other friends had been picking on him the most because he had been caught making out with his gf and beat him bloody. I knew nothing about it but was still shocked when I heard about it. That's when I toned down on the shenanigans. I stopped talking with that friend after that and he's now in prison for armed robbery.

As for me, I dropped out of college my first semester because I didn't like being away from home for so long. After working shit jobs for a while, I saved up and went to the local technical school and am working on becoming an electrician. I also have picked up a hobby in assembling computers and some programming. And I met a nice girl on Tinder who's in school to become a vet. So things are going okay.

Anyway, I was down at the gas station on Monday and pulled up to the pump. I look over and see this one kid who I really picked on a lot. He was your stereotypical nerd who was one of the smartest in the class and would read comics at lunch and was on the chess team. He got accepted into MIT I found out. I would do stuff like throw him into his locker, take his backpack and dump its contents on his head, tell him to buy me lunch if I forgot my own money (or because I just felt like it), etc. I didn't even realize it was the same person at first. I walk over to him and introduce myself and he gives me an ""Oh. You"" look before he finally acknowledged me. I asked him how he was and he gave me basically one-word answers and I knew he didn't want me around. So I slowly began to apologize for all the shit I did to him and he still was kind of standoff-ish.

But we talked for a little while longer and eventually I think he took a chance and accepted my offer to buy him a drink at the bar next door. We talked for about an hour, asking how he's been and all that. He actually just finished his undergrad last year and is working at IBM. I told him I was happy for him and I think he slowly began to trust me a bit and knew I was being sincere. I actually found out that we live in the same apartment complex just a building apart. What a coincidence! Anyway, we each gave our contact info just in case we wanted to hang out again.

I?m a teenager, my whole family immigrated from Iran, with my parents waiting to get married until they finished Med School, this ment they got married later and are considerably older than most parents, which led to me being born at an awkward time making me a multiple years older and a many years younger than everyone in my family. 

Past just age, they?re all different from me in ways I can?t understand, it?s like they?re all speaking some secret language that I don?t understand, everything about them is completely different from me and I can?t even hold small talk or form basic conversation. 

My family is very large and they all seem happy and together, every time I?m there I feel like I?m intruding and ruining the conversation, but I have this intense wanting to be included. But telling anyone about it seems impossible even thinking about it makes me curl up and want to hide, I?ve struggled with intense depression before, and I just want to feel together with my family.

I was quite extroverted and social as a young kid, I had a ton of friends and was often engaging in some sort of social activity. When I was around nine or ten, I moved to a new country. Over there, I had no friends and started to appreciate being on my own a lot more, just because of how often I was on my own.  Prior to this, I was usually always with someone, was only really on my own for short periods of time, and therefore assumed being alone would be bad. At first, I still wanted friends, but wanted to be on my own for the most part. As time went on, I started to make friends and over time they'd bore me or annoy me, and I'd stop being friends with them. I was introverted, but still wanted a social life, but I was bullied and ostracized. I often felt very lonely and depressed due to this. Beyond a point, I realized that I really don't get any enjoyment out of any of my relationships with other people. At this point I realized that I didn't really want any friends or relationships at all. I was very quiet for the most part, only talking when the teacher called on me or during presentations. For the most part, I ignored a vast majority of people, even when they were simply just saying Hi or something. During breaks (and even in class tbh), I'd just be fooling around on my own or reading a book. I did not feel any desire to have a relationship with my parents either, but I still talked to them out of obligation. After a while, I started to become really apathetic and disconnected from other people. I didn't really feel that much emotion, mostly just amusement or pride, and mild anger or frustration at times, although it was very fleeting. I became extremely apathetic, to the point where I didn't really feel fear anymore because I didn't care. I felt a major disconnect from everyone else, and although I always had trouble with emotion it just got heightened here. I wasn't completely bad socially, but I still did not really know how to deal with emotional situations and would feel nothing when people cried or someone died. For a long time I tried to convince myself that I did care, and did feel bad but I eventually realized that it's only logical to accept the truth and move on. For a long time I would get into a lot of trouble, but for the most part in high school I generally had good grades and did a few good extracurriculars so my parents did not mind and let me live my life. However, later on my parents starting complaining about how I had no friends and how I should be spending time with them now, as these will be the most fun years of my life. I decided to try once more, and now I just got more disconnected from people. Observing people socially, they really confused me. A lot of them couldn't tolerate others opinions and got mad at genuine criticism. They would react so stronlgy to praise and insult, and those did not affect me at all, so I started to view them as insecure pricks who needed validation. It became very easy for me to look down on the dumb, boring, unfunny, mainstream. I made a few 'friends' who were mostly like me, but we barely talked. We'd just do dumb and funny stuff together. I started to talk more, but mainly just to make sarcastic comments or to annoy people. With my general boredom in life, I craved the novel and exuberant things, so I decided to work hard in life so I would succeed as an adult. I came to terms with the fact that I would have to socialize to make good money, so I decided that I would talk to people at work but avoid them in my personal life. Again, continuing with my boredom, I became a massive adrenaline junkie just doing things for the thrill of them. Games, weed, the stupid yet funny shit I did, and my adrenaline inducing activities were the only things in life that really brought me joy. I did enjoy coding, science, and math too, but I wouldn't really do them in my free time to give me that thrill I craved. I found it ironic that I went from being so lonely to so happy on my own, but whatever. After I started to alleviate the boredom, I was and still am genuinely happy with my life and therefore felt no need to change it. When college started, I had to be social. There was no way around it, and I guess it would be the same way with work so I decided to try to an extent but mostly keep to myself. As I've said before, I'm really not that bad socially, most people think of me as funny, relaxed, and quiet. I still am very blunt and direct though. A lot of my friends started to date and have sex, but it really didn't interest me at all. If I felt any sexual urge, I'd masturbate but I felt no need to do it with another person if I could just masturbate to someone hot on my screen. And yeah that's about all there is to it. 

I don't really know why I made this post. Generally I don't really feel a need to 'get things off my chest'. Despite my asocial tendencies I do enjoy places like reddit and youtube and scroll them often without necessarily interacting with people (other than leaving sarcastic comments), and I've seen offmychest and found some of the confessions funny but again, I'd never expect myself to post here. I've never wanted a therapist for my 'issues' (I guess they're technically issues but I'm happy and it doesn't impact my productivity so who cares) because of what I said in the parentheses and also because not only do I not want to express my emotions and private thoughts, but also because I don't really feel a need to tell others stuff like this.

233,"My grandma passed away in June of 2018. She accidentally overdosed on an herbal medicine for diabetes and everything happened within minutes of drinking it. I was with her at the time. She was having a severe seizure so we put her in the car to take to the hospital. She was in my lap when she lost consciousness and died. We were extremely close and I always felt like she was the only person in my family I could talk to that would understand. She was the only person that cared more about me and my happiness than family reputation. 

It?s been almost a year since and something super weird happened today. I was taking a nap around 6:30pm and I dreamt that I saw her again and was talking to her about normal stuff like what I?ve been doing with my life. Then I realized that I was talking to a dead person so i went to my dad (in the dream) and I asked him ?What is this?? And he said ?You know it?s not really her right, don?t get used to this.? I went back to her and asked ?Why are you lying to me? You?re not real. Are you here to let me say goodbye?? And she didn?t say anything but I hugged her and cried (still in the dream). 

It was a very long hug and we fell to the ground hugging and it was so vivid like I could feel my hands running through her hair but I didn?t feel like it was real. I felt all the physical feelings of the hug just none of the emotions that usually accompany the hugs she used to give me. Then she said something along the lines of okay times up or you?ve had your moment or whatever and I could feel the life slipping out of her again and then she died again on top of me in my arms. 

I woke up and tried to move but I was paralyzed mostly I grabbed my phone cuz it was right next to me and I turned it on but I could only see a faint  outline of my phone and the actual screen itself was just a plain gray rectangle. I couldn?t move anything else and I yelled for my dad but he was still out so I just had to wait till I calmed down to move. 

I don?t think that was her spirit coming to visit me in my dreams cuz something about the energy was very off. She died on me and I couldn?t move cuz I was pressed down with the weight of my grandmas dead body. Even if it was her soul she wouldn?t do that to me when I?m a dream. It was my brain replaying traumatic events I think.

since he lost his job here what almost a year ago he lived almost free here. he paid a little rent maybe.. well until he didn't. used what money he had to go out to eat, shit like that. He didn't buy more than 3 packs of diapers and wipes. He didn't buy clothes, didn't buy toys, or formula, or anything for those babies.

I bought most of their toys, and clothing, medicine when they needed it. I was your babysitter when you needed one. I helped you, supported you when he was being an ass and he decided to leave before they were born and I let him come back for you. I was there for you when you suspected he cheated on you, hell i even made excuses when he hit on me while courting you, remember. I was honest and showed you the messages and explained them away. (stupid me)

But i am the bad guy,  somehow.

i spent a lot of money on you and him and the babies because i loved you and because i wanted to give you all the life you wanted. I told you go to school and i wont make you pay rent, won't make you get a job so you can get an education to get a better one..

I took you out to eat, bought you stuff, did everything for you, not once to make you feel you owed me, not to make you feel beholden to me but because simply i love you and them.

In the end now i feel that i never mattered to you beyond what i could give you, or spent on you. 

but his mom makes more than i do and gives her money much more freely, after al that's all i have heard since you went down there the first time to visit.

No you aren't money grubbing, that's not what i am saying. I am saying i believe that you think she will give you that life you want so much easier than i can. Support you for longer, after all i am dying.

but isn't she? didn't she have cancer? doesn't she have cancer?

from one dying woman you run to another but she gets all the perks of knowing you were moving, and i get all the heartache, and tears not knowing til you left.

i have been crying since you left, i am broken. I look around here and see you left behind all their toys that i bought them including their favorite toys. You left me a mess to clean up, left some of their stuff here but took what you wanted. Mostly left almost everything i ever bought them wiping me out of their life.

I know he convinced you to leave like you did, and that is why i am mad at him. I am mad only at him. You i cannot believe went along with not letting me hold and say goodbye to my grandkids. i cannot believe that you would be that heartless, that cruel to not even come say goodbye to me. To not even give me time to get used to the idea before you actually did it..

But he wanted to go fast, after all i am now pretty sure the woman he ""bought "" the car from didn't pay for all the repairs, tags and registration out of the goodness of her heart. 

i told you i have no reason to go ahead with dialysis. and i don't. you took that away. you will not make enough to come visit me, or get time off to do so. So i will never seee you or them again..and that hurts sooo much. Because the other day i lost my entire world. I don't know what i am going to do now.. but if i had to decide today.. i wouldn't go on dialysis so maybe its best if there is still time before i make that descision

and if by chance for some reason you do decide to come back, will i even be here? or have room for you. why should i continue to live in a 2 bedroom home when its only me or your uncle til he moves? or if i do get more ill and end up hospitalized or worse? 

A mom's job is to make sure that you have everything you need to continue on when they are gone, to be there to support you and help you when you need. you know that is my philosophy. I can only hope you have those tools and can continue on. 

And you can lie to yourself and say i was being mean, i was being nasty, i wasn't helping enough, doing enough. But i have gone over it and over it and i did more than most ever would have. I did nothing wrong, I did everything for you and maybe that's where i did go wrong.

Last night I went to my roommate?s friend?s 21st birthday party.  I don?t drink often at all but as you can imagine with a college 21st birthday the drinks were plentiful, and everyone there was pretty drunk by 10pm including myself. My roommate?s best friend (lets call him Jim) was also at the party with his girlfriend (lets call her Katie).  For more background, I?m also good friends with both Jim and Katie but my roommate has known them a bit longer.  

Katie has always been the flirty type, especially when she?s drunk and it honestly makes me slightly uncomfortable especially when Jim is around, as I don?t want an awkward dynamic between us all.  Anyway last night she really crossed the line.  I was in the apartment kitchen getting water from the tap and she came up behind me all flirty and handsy.  She started talking about how I?m her favorite of Jim?s friends and how much she liked my new haircut, I was just trying to downplay the compliments.  Then she forcefully threw herself at my face and kissed me pretty hard for a good 2 seconds before I could even register what was going on.  

I?m not going to lie, it felt fucking amazing (I know I?m a loser or whatever first kiss) and it made me feel so happy and appreciated.  Nobody saw this happen (that i know of) and I feel guilty as fuck even know I technically did nothing wrong.  Don?t know if I ever plan on telling Jim but I would be open to any advice, I just really needed to tell someone about it, and the mixed feelings i?m experiencing.

For the record I have zero feelings for Katie and wish their relationship the best, who knows if she?ll even remember what she did last night but it was still out of line.

I fell in love for the first time during late high school (currently about to start my masters in college). I met her back in middle school when she was a grade ahead of me but she moved away soon after. When she moved back we hit things off and became very close. Talked all day and all night. Stayed close to each other and were always there for each other. She had a lot of emotional problems from her childhood which made it hard to trust people fully but I managed to break through that. 

Eventually she asked if I had feelings for her and I said I did. But she was never looking for a relationship. Rather she focused that part of her mostly on short term flings with no strings attached. Which I thought I was fine with for the longest while. We talked about it a lot and a few times she told me she would give it a try but I said that it had to come from her not from me. Since we were so close I had a pretty clear idea of her romantic life. Sometimes she would talk to me about it and it just made me sad to hear her sad. She said a part of her did reciprocate but that just wasn?t what she was looking for. Being older now I understand that but at the time it was frustrating. She would tell me that  someday if neither of us found someone she would marry me. That idea just kinda stuck with me so I stayed along for the ride. In hindsight that wasn?t the best thing for either of us. Neither of us knew how to properly deal with those emotions. We eventually had a fight. Not about our feelings but fueled by them. I told her I needed time to cool down but I never talked to her after that. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I mainly have nightmares rather than dreams. I?ve always had a lot on my mind. But one day I didn?t have a nightmare. It was just her. All of the times we had together. When I woke up I couldn?t get her out of my mind. I talked to a friend who knew both of us and explained it. We agreed that there was no harm in reaching out so I did. I apologized for being so cold to her in the end and for my part in things. And she actually responded. Since then we have been talking more and more. The more I hear the more I remember how much I care about her.

Long story short: I fell into doing some hard drugs during some hard times. I found a great guy and we immediately fell in love with each other. I?ve been completely honest about my past and I told him that I dabbled in coke. Since we?ve been dating I?ve stopped doing it and told him that I don?t plan on doing it ever again (because let?s face it- there?s nothing positive about it and it doesn?t add any value to my life so fuck it) especially because he expressed that he wouldn?t want to be with someone who does it.

Or maybe it's more so that I fear having to let go of the person I dreamed of those wants with.

For the past month or so, my ex and I have been 'dating' so we could figure out if we still could be together, still enjoy each other, and if we can heal from the past few years of a very toxic relationship. During this time of ""dating,"" I can't say that he has been entirely honest with me and I constantly feel or see him changing what the terms of ""dating"" mean. 

For example, at first we would be dating and not talking to others... this changed without my being told until I found him talking to others on the plenty of fish app. He convinced me to allow him to talk to others and that that was all it would be, talking so that he could make friends.

Last night, he began saying that he would be also dating others. That I should know that talking to others would include dating. He also discussed that our terms of  ""dating"" are drastically different, which they very much clearly are. In terms of us, I would see dating as more of a serious thing as we are doing this in order to decide if we want a future together... but then isn't that why you also date other people as well? In his eyes, he says he sees dating as just having fun with other people and maybe getting to know other people.

After this discussion, I began to realize a few things... our wants are very different. Personally, I am 31 and at this point, I want marriage and children, that is what I am looking for and clearly not what he is. While, this is what I know I want for myself and what I want as part of my future, I don't know or believe he has the ability to give this to me. I love him and have always seen him as the one I would marry as well as have those children with, but maybe that no longer holds true.

The main point I need to take away and accept is that I  do know what I want. I want to be happy in my life, I want a partner to share it with, and I want to build a family of my own. But a part of me wants that to be with him. Although, there is only a very slim possibility of that happening in the future and it's very unlikely he will give it to me as he is only looking for 'fun' for himself at the present time.

So I need to decide... Do I keep waiting for someone that I love who *may* choose to be a part of my future or do I let go and find the person who shares the same wants as myself?

I had lots of love in my heart to give and I wanted to share it with you so you would understand that this didn't define you, that you are a beautiful soul regardless.

But everyone has their limits. One of my biggest fears was to be pushed past mine. Because, nostalgic as I may be, once I move on, I don't look back. And you have pushed me away many many times. This time was the final straw.

And now here I am, pushed beyond my limit, and I find myself no longer looking at you the way I used to. It makes me very sad. This is the point I feared the most because I wanted nothing more than to love you and be loved by you. It was supposed to be us against the world.

But you tossed me aside. Now I see what my gut tried to warn me about. I see now that it was always just you. I see now that this was a toxic and one-sided relationship. And now I'm at the point where i'm no longer angry, no longer sad, no longer heartbroken. Just indifferent, and ready to move on to the next chapter of my life without you.

My gran (mum?s mum) was just diagnosed with stage 2 cancer. I don?t live with my parents anymore, so my mum phoned me during the day to break the news. She was obviously and understandably not in the best of spirits but told me she was going to go home and tell my dad and brother and take some time to herself. 

At about 2am she messaged me on Facebook saying she wished I was home tonight and I was pretty worried, she?s never messaged me at this time before. I?m pretty sure she?d been drinking, which is something she never does, but she went on to tell me that she got no support from my dad, she told him her mum had cancer and his reply was ?alright? and later he said something passive aggressive towards her and that was all he said to her all day.

My dad is a pretty... emotionally stunted person I guess??? Both of his parents died of cancer when he was really young and as a result of this he?s never been good at showing affection or empathy. I don?t even really know how to describe it, but my mum cried and told me she really needed his support and she didn?t get it. She then went on to tell me that they shouldn?t have lasted as long as they have, deep down I?ve always known that my mum deserves better, although I do love my dad, but it was still a big shock for me to hear her actually say it.

303,"4 months ago, I met this guy when I was traveling. It was supposed to be a fling that stops when I finish my 11 days vacation. But I just couldn?t let him go.

I?m 5 hours ahead of him and 10 hours away. For gay guys, it?s nearly impossible to maintain a relationship with someone who?s reachable. Not to mention from this far. And we both know long distance relationships are not gonna work out. But with our hesitations, we still dived in.

I only get to talk to him during my afternoon and my nights. But it was all pleasant, there?s no awkward pause. Every conversation happened naturally and smoothly. I don?t have to find things to talk about, they just happen naturally. I?d sometimes fell asleep while texting like a high schooler.

I made my decision to go back for him after a month. I revisit him 3 weeks ago for another week, just for him. I?ve done some crazy stuff when I was young but this triumph every crazy shit that I pulled. Everything was great with him, everything about him made me fall deeper.

But I cannot ignore reality. We?ve made a deal that we?re going to try to relocate to another place-for other reasons, not for each other. And if we eventually make it, in 2 or 3 years. We?ll be together. 

I?m not a pessimist but it seems to me the possibility of us making it is next to none. Even tho he shed a tear when I was leaving him for the second time.

304,"\[M18\] In my junior year of HS, I was joking around with my friend (we'll call him Bill) saying how he flirts with every cute girl he sees on Facebook. As a joke, I thought it would be funny to set up a catfish account and joke with him a little since I knew he would message first, until I finally revealed it was me a week later. To cover up my identity, I sent friend requests to about 200 people in my school, and I played as an underclassmen. I asked if anyone wanted to DM me, and of course he messaged the catfish account first saying that I was ""cute."" The joke was successful and Bill and my friends thought it was funny once I revealed myself to them.

However, I kind of underestimated how thirsty guys were, and I maybe got over 100 messages from dudes all over my school trying to plow my sophomore alter ego. I only responded to a few people I knew to get a little chuckle from their responses, but I got bored of it after about a day and I just sort of forgot about it. There was one kid in particular though, who was pretty insistent to showing how um... sexually attracted he was to me. He would comment nut emojis under my profile picture, and DM me some pretty creepy shit (I know he wasn't joking because people have bashed him for saying shit like ""Bonerrific"" or how much he wanted to smash his ex-girlfriend under their photos). We'll call this kid Wolverine, since he had a strange obsession with him, and even had the sideburns grown out in inspiration of his haircut.

Now what I didn't know, was that I accidentally left my phone number on my Facebook account, and he was able to track down my Snapchat. What's even worse, is that my Snapchat profile picture was of one of my friends who knew about the catfish account, and Wolverine tried exposing him on Facebook. My friend and I tried to make light of the situation, but Wolverine kept writing long paragraphs out of blue ball anger. He said some pretty personal things for no reason, and my friend got a little angry and started beefing with him as a result. Out of nowhere, Bill comes in and starts goofing on Wolverine (they've talked a bit of shit to each other the year before, so I already knew this was going to end badly).

They ended up talking so much shit that Bill and Wolverine agreed to fight after school the next day, and talked about how they were going to beat each other's asses. In the thread of maybe 1000 comments, I jumped in multiple times telling them that fighting over something like just to get suspended was incredibly stupid. I even messaged Bill personally to forget about the whole thing, but he told me not to worry and that it's his choice if anyone gets in trouble.

I don't know what happened in detail the next day, since I wasn't there to see the fight, but apparently they saw each other in the hallway and flailed at each other for 2 seconds before they were split up by a teacher. They were put in ISS for 2 days and there were a bunch of rumors spread out saying that I intentionally set them up to fight after setting up a false date with both of them through the catfish account. Wolverine started ranting the next day about how he was wrongfully punished for fighting back in self-defense, which was obvious bullshit that most people called him out for. Me, my friends and Bill sort of just laughed it off and forgot about it.

I got some backlash for making the catfish account in the first place, which is understandable in a sense. I'm not going to deny the fact that I was a loser in high school, but I really never did encourage Bill and Wolverine to fight over something so stupid. It was just unnecessary and reckless.

This whole story is probably one of the reasons why I'm off social media like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. A lot of it is just stupid drama and I don't want any part in that kind of thing. On the outside, I would shrug off the situation if someone from my old high school were to bring it up. Yet, there are some days where I look back on this story and I feel like a huge asshole in this situation for accidentally having Bill and Wolverine re-encounter, only for them to fight for 2 seconds.

tl;dr - i set up a catfish account to mess with my friend, but it ended up gaining a lot of attraction from other guys and a kid got so offended that he tried to expose me and started writing long paragraphs to me and my friends after being blue balled. the friend that i messed with got mad at the pervy kid and they ended up fighting and being put in ISS for 2 days.",0,1556331504.0,bhuhi2,1,offmychest

For a long time I dealt with mixed feelings about you. There was hatred, questioning, longing for you, disgust, everything possible that I could feel; I felt. But as the years have gone on, I have come to the realization that the best thing you could have ever done was leave me. So, thank you. Not sarcastically, I mean it wholeheartedly. Thank you. 

You left when I was four. You left me with a dad who was so sick at the time he had to crawl on his hands and knees to get around. He had slipped a disc and been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease. My family has told me you didn?t even shed a tear when you got me dressed and put me on the school bus. I remember coming home and asking my dad where you were. I don?t remember exactly what he said but I do remember he kept reiterating that he would explain it to me once I was old enough to understand. The next year  would bring a lot of pain. My dad would proceed to become even sicker, developing many more health problems. I didn?t hear from you again until my baby brother was born  and my dad brought me to the hospital to see you and meet him. I didn?t hear from you for a while after that. 

I remember getting to visit you once, I came over for the weekend. You put on some facade of a ?loving mother? but only for a short time. We made a fruit salad, I was so happy. I was so happy to see you. I remember thinking how beautiful you were and how much I missed you. That night came crashing to an end when your new husband got fucked up on pills and started throwing knifes and forks at my baby brother and I, and through the innocent eyes of a child, I watched him choke you in the bathroom. You made me sleep on a blue cot in the living room of a strange house with no blanket or pillow. I came into your room after having a nightmare; only to have you and your husband cuss and scream at me. I sat on the cot and cried until I eventually went to sleep. You told me ?you cannot tell your dad what happened when you go home, or else you won?t get to see me anymore.? I was terrified. My dad noticed when I got home that I was acting strange, and kept asking me what was wrong.  I finally broke down and told him, and remember feeling so disappointed in myself that I had let you down. He said he was so mad that he saw red for two days. I stopped getting to see you. I thought it was my fault. 

At some point, I forgot what you looked like. I would have dreams about ?you? but it would always be a woman with pink hair for some reason. Every birthday and holiday I would wish that you were there. I would question my dad if I was the reason you left, I would convince myself that it had to be me. I assumed that anyone else who came into my life would abandon me. You gave me my first set of trust issues. I was in the 4th grade, my dad aspirated in his sleep and gets put into a medically induced coma. You decide it?s a great time to start a custody battle. I fail the 4th grade, due to stress and not being able to focus on my school work. This turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. I ended up becoming friends with an amazing, supporting group of people. Over the years, you would be in and out of my life. Having multiple husbands and boyfriends over the years. You would develop a drug addiction and become an alcoholic. You would steal your mother, my grandmothers pain medicine while she was dying from cancer. When I was finally old enough to understand, my dad revealed to me that you had cheated on him with the husband that choked you. I saw how bad you hurt my dad. He went to his grave still loving you for some reason; I found the love letters and poems he had written for years after you left. 

Thank you for giving me the most amazing dad that I could have ever had. Someone who loved me unconditionally and supported me though everything I did in life. Someone who for 18 years played the role of mom and dad. Someone who did the best they could despite their health issues. Someone who instilled in me love, respect, and empathy for others. Someone who never ceased to make me feel loved when I felt like my own mother couldn?t love me. Thank you for giving me the motivation to have a good life, a life nothing like yours. Thank you for leaving me; I couldn?t imagine how bad my life would have turned out with you as an influence. Because of you, I strive to do well in school and make something of myself. I?ve worked so hard to get myself into nursing school. Thank you for never being a mom so that when I become a mother, I can give my child all the love that you never gave me.

She does not plan on telling her family because she ""knows they will get too involved"". She also does not have the most open relationship with her parents.

I am not ignorant to the disease by any means. I know that it is a mental condition and not out of vanity, and she knows that she can count on me for my support.

I also told her that she SHOULD tell her parents about it because they will be able to help financially and even if their actions may seem overbearing, they will be coming from a place of love and concern - not from a place of anger or disgust. I want to help her get healthier and feel confident about her body, but I know that my responsibilities should be limited and I shouldn't make this the new forefront of our relationship. I know that her getting better will take time (even years).  I GUARANTEE, for every one thing she says she hates about her body, I could name five things I admire about her. Lol.

We met at a social group and ended up really clicking. We've known each other for about a year now, and a little while ago I started developing feelings. I tried sorting through it with my therapist because I knew things wouldn't work, and didn't act on it. She ended up having to drag it out of me at one point and we talked about it. She's not attracted to me, which I figured, but also lamented that fact because the friendship otherwise is great. There's fondness, trust, understanding and respect, not to mention a similar sense of humor, and of course she's absolutely gorgeous and intelligent. I'll admit, I identified as a gay man for a while, but my crush on her made me realize that I am actually *wildly* bisexual.

After a bit she also discussed having sex with me since she was a virgin and wanted to ""get that part over with."" (I know, now, and my therapist pointed that out) Of course it didn't work out. It was mostly heavy petting at best, and me doing things to her. It was really frustrating.

After that we tried the cuddle buddy route. I was actually really happy about that, as it felt good and was more than I was really hoping for. Until someone else from that group met up with her one day, they were hanging out as friends at first until the other gal (not my friend) tried to push her into having sex, then pressured her to cuddle. She couldn't do it with me after that. That part hurt, as it felt like *I* was being punished for someone else being an asshole, but I HAVE NOT and WILL NOT bring that up to her, as it's selfish and is my issue to deal with. It still hurts though.

I've been through a lot of abuse in my life, to the point where I look back and can't think of *anyone* that was ever as truly into me as I was them. I was a verbal and emotional punching bag, and sometimes unwilling jerkoff sleeve for some of them. I sometimes feel a bit used by her, though I don't think she's doing it on purpose.

The other issue though, is that at one point she said to me ""If you do manage to convince me to date you you should see that as a win. All's fair in love and war, and all.""

Both my therapist and my big brother asked me ""what is that supposed to mean?"" All I could say was ""I don't know."" But I don't *want* to have to knock myself out for someone like that, as I've done it before, with most of my past relationships, and I don't see having to *convince* someone to fall in love with me like that as a ""win"".

I've fallen into a depressive hole over this once before, and now I feel like I'm about to again. It hurts that I don't even have ONE halfway decent relationship to look back on and say ""at least they actually cared, at least they tried."" I have been thinking for about a month now that I might have to tell her that we need space. It sucks because she's a good friend otherwise, just young, immature about relationships (she wants someone who can sweep her off her feet, and I can't do that because I have spinal issues that necessitate a wheelchair sometimes among other things. She didn't just tell me that, I asked. My fuckup), and struggling with other stuff. All these and other reasons why I tried to keep my crush a secret and work on it on my own.

I keep doing this. Trying to bust my ass for someone I like that doesn't feel the same way. I'm still so codependent and while I've been trying to work on it it's still hard.

I'm not sure I'm ready for dating or a romantic relationship, but trying to find a FWB is hard too, and doesn't really give me what I want and need too.

No, that?s not possible. Today, Prom came up and that small piece of me extinguished when I heard a 20yr old will be your date. Part of me cried inside but another part realized that it was a sign. A sign to finally move on. I was given the grace of being let down implicitly and gentle, even if it pained me a lot. Writing this out does make me feel better. I?ll move on and hope your future is prosperous.

He was also taking 2 to 3 naps a day and for a guy who usually can't sit down for 2 seconds, that was concerning. He went to the doctor to check out his hand and he was misdiagnosed with a damaged tendon in his arm or a pinched nerve.

My sister-in-law just got engaged, they are getting married in 2020 on the 25th of this month. She was part of my wedding party. I asked her to be my maid of honor because I have no friends and I had hoped her and I would become really good friends, that didn't happen. She severely let me down. I ended up doing most things alone and no one asked me what I wanted to do for my bachelorette party, so we ended up doing something I truly hated. I felt alone the entire time I was planning my wedding. Honestly, if I could go back I wouldn't have wanted a bridal party. We did one because my husband has lots of good friends and he really wanted them to stand up there with me. So I put together a mix-match of my husband's family, his close female friend, my family, and one friend who I don't see really anymore.

My wedding wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I know that people say it shouldn't be considered the most important day of your life, but as someone who never gets acknowledgment or the opportunity for just one day to be about them, I wanted it to be. Picked out a beautiful venue and put together a great plan, and of course, it rains. So no outside ceremony, instead we got the ugly pavilion which is now part of all my pictures and my video. My family left right after dinner, they didn't stay for anything extra and honestly, all I had attend was family so the room was extremely empty except for my husband's friends and family. We ended the reception early because people were leaving because we picked a Sunday because of the date. He was born 2/22 and I am born 6/22, so we got married on 4/22. Corny, I know, but I liked that it was directly 2 months between his birthday and my birthday.

So throughout my engagement, I did everything pretty much alone or with my husband. So, my sister-in-law (maid of honor) got engaged less than a month ago. I can't stop the envy and hatred I keep feeling for her and her engagement. I found ways to skip the initial dinners after it happened just so I wouldn't have to see the ring, or her joy, or any of that. I was already jealous of how cute she and her fiance are together. They are such a cute couple, both thin and photogenic. Taking lots of pictures together and just being loved by all who come in contact with them. While my husband and I are both big, don't photograph well, and I am a severe let down in comparison with how much people love him. So I now get to see tons of Facebook posts of their engagement pictures and her constant posting about her wedding. I then started to make myself sick at the thought of her asking me to be in her bridal party. The fear of being a pity member of a bridal party that will contain lots of thin, ultra pretty girls with perfect hair, makeup, and actual friendship. I finally broke down to my husband about not wanting to be in it because I would ultra stand-out and I would know, deep down, that I was a pity member. Her asking because I am her brother's wife and not because we are actually friends. I recognize how self-centered this is because she hasn't asked and I shouldn't feel so special that I would get asked. I recognize that, but this is a fear that has been lingering inside of me.

I am envious of how perfect everything is going for her. I am envious of the fact that my day was not perfect and most likely, because of how her luck runs, hers will be perfect. I want to be happy for her but at the same time, I want to yell at her how much she let me down as a maid of honor.

Of course, when I have voiced all of what you just read to my husband he gets sad that I feel our wedding wasn't great or perfect. He loved our wedding.

We finally were able to travel places, take mini trips and everything was fine and dandy. I gave this girl EVERYTHING. If I didnt have the money for it I would some how make it happen.

She stayed quiet, so i said "" Your silence and crying gives me your answer, If you feel like this decision will make you happier that I was, I respect and understand you decision"" and walked out the room devastated.

Yes, I did ask questions during the talk like ""if there was anyone one else"" ETC. I genuinely believe her with she said there wasn't.

Within the past 3 weeks I had decided I didn't want to sleep with him anymore.

I also have some confusion/trauma around sex and when I start feeling this way about someone, I shut down in the sex department and I have a hard time with communication.

I immediately shut down and said we should head back to the car because it was getting cold.

I never said no, I dissociated, I went along with it just so it would be over. The whole time I was just thinking I wanted to be done.

I will say that there's going to be talk of suicide here, no one actually commits suicide, but there's a lot of talk about it.

I'm  a senior in high school, and the kid I'm talking about, who I'll call R  if needed, is in the 10th grade. We have the same second block class  and we sit beside each other. Throughout the semester the group that we  sit around has gotten ""closer"", as in we just fuck around the whole  class, but that's about it. We're not *actually* closer or like, close knit friends or anything.

R  is basically a Kurt Cobain wannabe, and it's extremely cringy to listen  to him talk about him so much, even going as far as to call him his  mentor, or say that he is the reincarnation of him. I think the last one  was a joke, I hope. Regardless, he's obsessed with Nirvana, which in my  opinion is a phase he will grow out of. I was obsessed with Nirvana, as  well as many others. It gets old. Anyways, he's still a decent kid,  he's funny, and I would go as far as to call him a friend, but I'm  starting to get a little irritated. Him and his best friend have been  having issues, and it's a pretty garbage situation, but if the old best  friend wants to act the way she is, that's on her. People turn their back on you sometimes, but you'll meet new people.

He  also apparently has a pretty shit home life. He says his mother kicked  him out of the house and basically only lets him come in to get food, to  shower, or to get new clothes. Otherwise, he's outside, and apparently  he's had to sleep on the side of a street. I don't know how true this  is, and I find it hard to believe. He's extremely attention seeking as  well, which is an issue that should be handled on it's own, and I don't  think it's something he should be shamed for. I think it's due to  circumstance and possible mental illness. Yesterday and today he came  into class and talked about how much he wanted to die, about how much he  didn't want a funeral, and he wanted his ashes to be put into a trash  bag and so on. Listening to him drone on and on about him dying was  getting on my nerves and quite frankly, I'm getting sick of it.

Here's  the thing. I've been through the same thing. The contemplating suicide,  but not really ever doing anything about it because you know deep down  things aren't always going to be like this. I sound super selfish  admitting all of this, but I have my own problems, and I don't need to  feel like I'm taking responsibility for some kid's life. I'm not. I  still have my own issues, my own set of mental illness problems, I can't  be someone else's therapist. Today, he literally asked me, ""Can I  commit?"" I said no. He didn't finish the entire question, but I knew  what it was about. He asked multiple people and then proceeded to  explain, ""You'll be in my suicide note, and here are XYZ reasons why.""  He also flashed around these scrapes he scratched into his arm and asked  if he could do more or do worse.

And  then came the super-extra awkward part. He asked me that if things  didn't go well with his best friend, would I be his best friend. I don't  do best friends at this point.

335," In high school, I had very few close friends who were my age. My closest confidantes were a year or two older or younger; a year really makes all the difference. I've always had a somewhat childish personality; I can't goof off with anyone like I can with the guys I knew in high school who are currently juniors and seniors. I can only genuinely say I've had one best friend, and that was born out of years and years of building trust, but I moved around so much as a kid that we rarely talk anymore.

After making it to college, I made friends with multiple different friend groups who were in my year, but never *truly* connected with them except one person. I've always been a one-close-friend kind of girl, as opposed to many-distant-friends. Around this time, I was going through a breakup and didn't want to feel the hurt, so I saved it for later. First semester, I got closer to that one friend and convinced myself that I had feelings for him because I didn't want to think about the breakup. It was a blessing in disguise that that same friend rejected me, because I realized later that I was using him as an escape. My ex and I started up again, this time on a long distance relationship.

He had changed, though, since I'd last seen him, and our round two only lasted a month. But this second breakup was the real closure I needed, because neither of us had wanted to break up during round one. The thing was, now that we were officially over, I was forced to wake up and not feel as numb as I'd been feeling during and after the relationship. And apparently, I had a *lot* of baggage that I had to deal with.

I had to deal with my distant relationship from my parents, with the fact that my self esteem was not as high as I'd originally thought it was, with the realization that the friends I have aren't life-long ones. Further, that one friend and I got more distant as I started developing feelings for him again. I'm still not sure if those feelings were real, or if they were just a response to the baggage that dropped all at once.

Anyway, this was all raging whiplash to my college friends. I even felt it myself; I was full of life, and then somewhere along the way I had an existential crisis and now I have to fake smiles. I feel like they're exhausted that there's always something bad happening to me, so I try to pick my chin up and be the way I was before. I know that they're not *actually* annoyed with me, but I can't help feeling that way. Then the dynamic between me and my close friend shifted for the worse, because he still wasn't interested and I didn't want to confront him about my feelings since I was dealing with so much else. A rejection on top of that wouldn't have helped.

Now, I feel lonelier than ever. Everyone I feel comfortable with is at least five-hundred miles away from me. I hardly trust anyone here enough to confide in, and the one person here who I *would* confide in is pushing me away because he doesn't want to give me false romantic hope. Everyone has a friend who's close to them; I'm not even pissed that that friend isn't me. I see everyone with people who they've known for forever, who they trust more than anyone in the world, who'll stick with them no matter what problems they're going through. I want that so badly. I have so many people who I can ring up to go to a party with, but I no longer have That One Person who I can call in the middle of the night for some hole-in-the-wall Mexican food or a late-night drive to a whole other state. All the friends I have right now, I feel like they won't want me when I'm sad or down, and a lot's been going on recently that I've been sad and down a lot. They've said and shown that they're happy to stand by my side while I get back up, but deep down I can tell that they'd rather spend time without me around to kill the party. And honestly, I'm trying so hard to go back to the happy girl they knew and befriended in the first place, but my loneliness is practically suffocating me.",0,1556326096.0,bhtov6,1,offmychest

It all started a month ago....

We had been out all day in a big group drinking. It was almost 7PM when my friend suddenly punches our guy friend in the chest and starts wagging her finger at him saying, ?Don?t f\*\*\*ing touch me?.  Then she turns to me and says, ?He just grabbed my ass? and goes back to berating him.

The thing is, no one knew I'd just been drinking water. I witnessed everything go down. He didn't touch her.

I thought she?s wasted, maybe someone else grabbed her...she?s confused. I comforted her but I felt so bad for the guy when I saw his face. His demeanor had completely changed. He looked shocked.

Her and I left shortly after that and to be honest I probably wouldn?t have given the incidence another thought. But when we were in the taxi talking she brings it up again and starts telling me how this guy was all over her the entire night. 

That?s when I knew 100% she was making it up. I didn?t know what to say...he wasn?t even around us and she was dancing with some other guy the entire time. I told her to speak up earlier next time but the next day I couldn?t stop thinking about it. 

&#x200B;

And now I think she?s done this before...maybe several times. Just the week before we went to a concert with another friend and she said our friend's boyfriend tried to kiss her when they went to get us drinks. She begged me not to tell our friend. She said she was worried our friend would have a breakdown. So I agreed to keep it quiet but now I think she might have made that up too.

337,"So I've just broke up with my girlfriend, we'd been together for 2 years but had broken up for a couple of months in between because I wasnt happy with how things were. She was very paranoid and would often cause fight because I'd see my friends and made out like I was doing that instead of seeing her, but I'd always planned in advance so shed know I was going to be busy. She was extremely needy, but I always tried to understand and reassure her and I'd make sure when we were together we'd have fun.

Anyway, after the first time she broke up I was angry at first (I'd broken up with her) and I took a trip to London alone that was meant to be for us. I saw friends while I was down there and hooked up with one girl and thought right, that's it, I'm over her. I was wrong. I never cut contact with her but she blocked me on a few things, but I still checked in and stuff mainly to make sure she was ok. She was, she seemed like she was flourishing, and she seemed like the person I'd always said that she could be and how I wished she was ( bit shitty of me but idk). 

I got back in contact with her and then one thing lead to another and we got back together. Things were good, we were happy and I thought maybe the break was what we needed, but nothing lasts forever and slowly but surely, it started to go back to how it was, we started to fight more and more often until finally I'd had enough.

Right now I'm angry, angry at her for not being who I wanted her to be, angry at myself for throwing it away, angry at the way things ended and for upsetting her. But I'm scared that history will repeat itself, and I'll start to feel lonely and I'll regret this. I'm scared to not be angry.

It all started when a friend of ours set us up claiming we both wanted to hook up, nothing serious. I just had gotten out of a really fucked up experience with a guy who treated me poorly, so my expectations were quite low when our friend told me about him. I didn't even want to meet him but eventually I just thought ""Fuck it, let's do this"" and gave it a go. When we first talked, something about him intrigued me, and that sensation was confirmed when we met in person. We immediately clicked, spent hours talking and I felt head over heels about him and it was mutual.

Both of us have been upfront about our intentions since the very beginning: we both were reluctant about having a relationship and agreed on taking whatever we were having as it came, spontaneously, and also decided to be as honest as we could in case feelings came in the way.

&#x200B;

One month into this situationship, we've been in constant contact, always hanging out anytime we can, we've been treating each other kindly and affectionately, we even already have inside jokes and the chemistry between us is from another world, something I've never experienced, and I started questioning my feelings towards him for a while, trying to convince me that it's impossible to fall for someone in such a brief time. Joke's on me, I've never been truly in love with any of my previous partners (or at least I was in love of the idea of them), but this time I can see the person he is, and he's wonderful, caring, brilliant, handsome, I could go on for hours. I always think about how amazing he is and how fortunate I am to have met a person like him. I appreciate and adore every part of him, I can't think of anything I would change about him, I utterly adore him.

&#x200B;

We recently addressed the ""feelings and relationship"" topic again and straightforward told me he's not ready for a relationship (which I didn't ask for) and doesn't even want to know whether I'm dating other people or not (which I am not, even though I agreed about not being exclusive). I was totally satisfied about being on the same wavelenght, or so I thought.

I've always wanted to be in an open relationship, since I felt suffocated by monogamy in my previous exclusive relationships, and when we decided the ""terms"" of our affinity I couldn't feel more excited about it. But then I realised that I actually didn't want to date other people.  I've also been wondering whether he is, but I don't want to know because I'm afraid of the answer. Having the possibility to choose between him and other people always lead me to choose **him**. That's when I first started questioning if I was feeling more than I should.

In the past days I've noticed he's being distant; we don't text as often as we used to, he's not enthusiast about hearing from me, he sometimes disappears for hours and sometimes doesn't even answer to my texts.

I cried over feeling forgotten by him, and that was the epiphany that got me to realise I was fucked up. I don't like this feeling.

339,"So a little back story, me, my sister, and a friend spent a night at a nearby spa place. I had told my mom a few days before hand where we were going and what place this was. To my surprise she didn't really care or try to stop us from going. So we went. Fast forward to the next morning at 7 AM, she is blowing up me and my sister's phone non stop. Telling us how it's not safe and to go home immediately. Being half asleep, we didn't really pay any mind to her and just fell asleep again. 9 AM comes she is calling again, so I answer. Same convo, ""it's not safe, it's dirty"" So I tell her, being half asleep, ""if it's not safe, I wouldn't be talking to you. So relax, we are leaving now."" Throughout the day, she was out. But when dinner rolls around, she goes off. She is yelling at me at full speed, about how it's not safe, how it's dirty. That there are diseases in the chairs and beds, how those places are for prostitutes (she is an immigrant from a different country, so she bought a lot of those beliefs here to the US). I try to tell her it's not the same and how it's not like that here (honestly, I'm not really sure but this place was a proper spa, I had done my research). But she doesn't care and doesn't even hear me. She continues about how I could even think about bring my younger sister there, she is over 18 and more rebellious than me, nothing I could've done would have stopped her anyways. 

This all happened at the beginning of dinner so I left the table, I decided that I didn't need the negativity coming from her and I have no more interest in eating with her in that situation. I feel like I should have let her go off, but it was more stressful keeping my mouth shut than leaving. I definitely could have yelled and argued with her, but learning from experience, it was better to just not saying anything to her. I understand where she's coming from that she was worried about my safety, but at the same time, if she was worried, why didn't she say something to me BEFORE I went? I could've stayed home or find a different activity to do. It feels like she planned this out to have an argument with me.

340,"I've been friends with the guy since around 2-3 years ago and he's become one of my closet friends. We both like a lot of the same things and have deep and meaningful conversations about every kind of topic. Obviously we have things we disagree on and its always nice to debate about them. 

Anyways, he told me he was gay about a few months after we started hanging out and I didn't really thought anything about it. Its not something that would made me feel more distant towards him cause I really enjoyed my time him. He knew I was straight and so he didn't try to make moves on me. However, when we where at parties and drunk, his control over his pulsions would sometimes making him do things he wouldn't normally do, as all people who are intoxicated.

One time, maybe around 1 year ago, we where coming back from a party and since my house was close, he crashed at my place to sleep. We had another few drinks and were quite drunk. Before we went to sleep, he was being very touchy touchy and I didn't really think anything about it cause I was hammered but he started slowly bringing me towards the room in which he was sleeping. He then kind of pushed me on the bed and I told him something along the lines of ""dude what are you doing?"". He told me""you know what I'm doing"" and at that point I just wanted to go to sleep so I just told him to give me a kiss on the cheek so I could get out of the situation. He did so and I went back to my room to sleep. We both woke up the next morning like nothing happened, but I felt really awkward about it and I never told him about it.

Another time, he was at my home and I was taking a shower. Again, we where both drunk and comming back from a party. Just for context, he crashed a lot of times at my place and the examples I'm giving are just very few instances. Anyways, he then entered the bathroom and I was like ok whatever but he the procedeed to enter the shower. Again, I told him something along the lines of ""dude what the hell"" and quickly finished rinsing the soap to get out. Same thing next morning, everything went back to normal and I didn't told him how uncomfortable he made me feel.

The last time he did something sketchy was when we were at a friends party a few weeks ago and went to the bathroom together to take a piss. I do this very often with him and other guys when were drunk cause we don't really care and want to continue the conversation were having. As we were talking and pissing, he just suddenly grabed my dick with is index and tumb and told me I had a big dick. On the moment, again, I didn't really think anything about it and even said thanks as a reflex. The next morning, my feelings all came crashing down and I thought ok this is enough, I have to talk to him about it.

I always postponed this thought since I'm not someone who shares my feelings to others a lot and I abhor the thought that speaking out might create a conflict. The guy is one of my bestfriends and I didn't know what would happen if I spoke out to him about how his actions made me feel really uncomfortable. 

Anyways, I sorted out my thoughts and feelings and the next weekend, when we were outside alone at a party, I talked to him about of I felt. I told him about my feelings and how he needed to stop doing those kind of things and he interrupted me in middle of my sentence and said ""I understand, I won't ever do something like that again"". He told me how he felt from his perspective that, even though he knows I'm straight, he always had that hope inside of him that I could reciprocrate his feelings. He had more hookups with straight guys than gay ones so he always thaught it could be a possibility. He said he was really glad I told him about it instead of keeping it for me.

I just feel so relieved right now and like I'm on a cloud. I never thought expressing my feelings could make me feel so good. I want to finish this post by telling to everyone that felt like I did about sharing your feelings, don't think that way. You will feel so much better after expressing yourself and telling others, especially your closed ones, how you feel.

I've been completely in love with this girl for over a month now and I've said nothing. She is one of the kindest, most beautiful people I've ever met. She is caring and nice and she is a really genuine person. I can't look away from her, both physically and mentally, I actually kinda want to ask her on a date. Here is the catch though. I am getting married to the mother of my child this August and this crush is fucking destroying me. 

It feels so fucking wrong to have these feelings for her as I know that I love my fianc? and I love my child. At the same time I know that I am young, very young. My son was born the spring before I turned sixteen. And now me and my fianc? are getting married a week after I'm 18 and can legally marry. 

And I'm kinda having second thoughts and kinda not. We've been together for 5 years, so it kinda feels like we belong together. At the same time I feel like this would have ended a long time ago if not for our kid. And I don't want him to grow up in a split home. My parents are still friends but it was such a hassle having to move every week and shit like that.

I feel so fucking bad and it feels like my heart is about to give out and I just want to forget the crush forever but at the same time I cherish her friendship so fucking much and I don't want to lose it.

I was 26 at the time and obviously the whole thing was a big hit on my family and especially on my mother.

It was probably the toughest thing I ever did calling her and telling her the bad news (I don't live close to where my family lives that's why I called).

I think any mom would handle such a situation with difficulty and I tried to support her as much as I could by assuring that things were going well and I was doing OK (which I actually was, therapy went well, I had lots of friends visiting and when my family visited we could even head out for ice cream or stuff like that).

Let?s call her J. I hate her guts. Putting too much personal info on this account because the self-destructive part of me hopes she sees this. We?re both 19F and go to different colleges. I literally can?t stand her anymore. She?s super judgemental, a hypocrite (literally shat on people who watch anime hardcore for years knowing i liked it, yelled at me for it and didn?t care that i told her to stop, then started watching it herself and became a really cringey weeaboo). She always has to be right and will constantly say mean things about the things i like and gets mad at me when i don?t say i agree with her and fights me over it and treats me like an idiot for it. She?s never apologized for anything she?s done, she?s so toxic.

She texts me 50-100 times a day, only to complain. If I don?t respond, seem disinterested, challenge her shitty behavior (?why are my roommates pissed I?ve never done the dishes?? I only use a couple dishes per week I?m allllways getting takeout. Cups don?t count?), or just don?t 100% agree with her opinion she mocks at me.

She?s aggravated 24 fucking 7 and always picks a fight with me. She knows I have a ton of mental illness and have a shitty life and honestly she always manages to make my bad days 10x worse and ruin my few good days. I want to cut off this toxic friendship so bad but she?s literally a leech. Talks about how scared she is of people leaving her every damn day and has guilt tripped me and made me promise to ?never leave her? at least 10 times now. I feel guilt tripped and she knows so many of my secrets that I?m scared of what she?ll do or just what mean things she?ll say to me if I tell her I don?t want to be friends anymore. Selfishly, I?m also scared because even though our conversations are literally preventing me from having even a few happy moments in my life, she?s the only person I talk to consistently and I?m already so lonely.

Ok. So let's start by saying this was a gradual descent into hating this company, the last straw situation. I am a registered veterinary technician (animal nurse) and have always advocated for insurance as a benefit to pets and owners financially. This company also ""prides"" them selves in having the most coverage compared to any other companies, and for some cases Ive seen, I've been pleasantly surprised at what they had covered. Started out with positive view of them here, but boy, have they ever pissed me off now.

I'll start with a history here, a bit about my role in this, then I'll explain the insurance part. 

Smushers is our now 8 month old kitten who's got a slew of issues that have slowly each presented themselves as he grown older. I am a registered veterinary technician (animal nurse) and work in an emerge/reg practice currently. When I first got him, he was 6 weeks old. He was part of a litter of kittens who was being fostered by another technician, and he was the fattest floof of all of them. He was majestically plump. I, being a technician, had always advocated for medical Inssurance for pets, because medical issues can be costly and I had know that young animals are very prone to foreign bodies (ie, eating string, toys, things they shouldnt) and requiring surgery. So, being the proactive technician I thought I was, at 6 weeks old I signed him up for insurance. 

Now let's start the medical history lineage. 

At 8 weeks old I brought our beautiful white floof to my colleague veterinarian as a kitten 1st vaccine appointment (my first mistake there) Everything was great, until he listened to his heart. He had a whopping murmur and his heart sounded like an ocean. This was only 2 weeks after his enrollment, so the doctor didn't note it in the files but had verbally told me. This insurance company has a 30day wellness period in which anything noted isn't covered medically. I had called the company to ask a few questions about heart coverage and claims, and had gotten some disheartening news, but carried on. 

Fast forward to October 12th, 1 day after his wellness waiting period for coverage is over. Hes not doing well, fast breathing, dull, excessive drooling, diarrhea, vomiting, head pressing against objects, and hes still a small kitten even for now being 3 months old. Is this his heart or something new now?
Took blood, he was anemic, had low BUN and Creatinine values which were leading us to think liver shunt. Wanted to check out his heart at this point to see what was going on. Had ultrasound and result was sent off to cardiologist which came back as right side heart enlargement with mitral valve deformations, not impeding or causing any clinical signs seen currently. 
Ok, so his heart sucks but isnt the cause of his current symptoms. What now? More diagnosis to find out what the heck IS going on. 

Gave antibiotics which resolved his issues and further strengthened the notion that maybe he had a liver shunt and his symptoms wernt related to his heart. Few weeks later tried lactulose, he improved again, strengthening possible liver shunt theory. Another few weeks later did bile acid test, came back abnormal, high suspect for liver shunt at this point considering his now tiny stature compared to his brothers and clinical signs present without medicine. 
Called Hills nutritionist and got nutrition consult on what food to feed liver shunt kitten, considering hes developing, got recommended K/D (kidney care diet) as its low in protein and good for liver shunt cats. 

Ok. So hes got these two main issues. Now it's a few months later and I've paid his Bill's, and am now submitting his first claims to insurance. His heart was immediately denied because of the phone call I made to the company. They considered it part of his history as an owner diagnosis and thus put him back in the waiting period where it isn't covered. F**k. Ok, my bad, I screwed up. 

Now its been 3 weeks later and they've finally come back with a denial for his liver shunt, claiming, and I quote ""these signs would have been readily observable or reasonably know to be present before you enrolled"". So at 6 weeks old, my plump adorable visably healthy kitten should have been know to have a liver shunt. 

That. That last line is f**king ridiculous to me. I get I messed up by calling the company about his heart, but the liver shunt?!? How is anybody suppose to know their animal has a liver shunt when it's a baby?!? I'm a technician for heaven sake and I missed it until a few months later!!! Is an owner suppose to have medical foresight and say ""hey, my golden here is going to have cancer when its 5, and therefor wont be covered by insurance because I should have known""???? WHAT?!?

so the just of the whole thing is that i should have known all of the medical defects this fluffy white ball of cuteness should have had when he was 6 weeks old. And the insurance company has slimly gotten out of helping me with any of it. I thought I was all for insurance before this, but now I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless it's a complete accident that happens to your pet, then it might be covered. But who knows, maybe you should have known your dog was going to get hit by a car, and then they wont cover you. 

I'm so mad. 
I don't even mind paying for his things, but the fact that they've intentionally tried to find ways to get out of it, all while taking my money monthly is the last straw. 

TLDR: company tells me I should have known my visibally healthy kitten was going to have multiple internal congenital conditions at 6 weeks old and wont help with any of them.",0,1556291561.0,bhnex6,5,offmychest
353,"I have realised that part of my fear of leaving the house and interacting with people and strangers and fearing offending them without meaning to and fearing not being liked and then being attacked is from my ambitiously vengeful and mean-spirited sister. I have cut contact with her, however, whenever she get a chance she would turn other family members against me and get them to yell at me. 

Twice now, my dad called me out of the blue and started yelling at me. I didn't understand what he was mad about. He eventually calmed down when I started to cry and could not understand how something so small turned into something huge and out of proportion. 

I stopped going to family events because whenever I went, she would act very petty towards me and cut me off conversations with other people. My family doesn't say anything to her and now they are angry with me for cutting contact with my sister.

Recently I have been having some issues with her and I might as well just post it on here. My friend has always been very emotional about everything and has a lot of anxiety. One thing I have noticed over the last few years is how great of a person she is and how she can't handle anything emotionally. I have talked to her about grades and stuff like that, but whenever I start talking to her about the things I'm having problems with she kind of shuts down and says something along the lines of ""oh ok well I've gotta go"" or she changes the subject to something else. I'm sure I'm blowing everything out of proportion but in about 10 days I am going to be a senior in high school and it's been stressing me out really bad. I've tried to talk to her about everything, but I just feel like my problems are being looked over, they aren't very important, or she is uncomfortable and doesn't know what to say. It's just been frustrating because I'm the kind of person who bottles things up and then I have to let it out when I can't handle it anymore.

366,"So, to start I am just going to say that I am 78% sure I am gay. I cant say that I am fully gay, because I feel like I want to have a wife and kids, because that's what everyone expects me to do, but at the same time I find some guys hot, others cute and I just want to be in a relationship with them. For now let's say I am gay. No one knows yet. Absolutely no one. I think that some of my very old friends suspect me, but I am not sure. Anyway I am at a new school for electronics. This is my first year in it and I think that most of my classmates are great. I already have some friends with which I am pretty close with. One of them is kinda acting gay, but I am not sure if he is gay, but we have a lot in common and we laugh quite a lot. I don't have any special feelings about him tho. We are in some kind or group together with another guy who I think is straight but I am not sure, cuz he hasn't shown all this much attention to girls or guys or anyone. So let's just call him the kinda straight guy. He is the one I am really into. He is veeeryyyy cute. I like the way he talks to everybody. He is very respectful, understanding and sweet. He also makes great jokes and I sometimes make him laugh too and most of the times the three of us, me, the kinda gay guy and the kinda straight guy, laugh a lot. I mean like a lot. I feel like the three of us are very good friends, but I just have some feelings about one of them that I have never had before. For example I like seeing that he is not perfect. I feel like his imperfections make him even cuter. And did I mention that he is really hot too. Omg. His body just looks soo good. I feel like I can watch him for hours and not get bored. But the thing that I really really like is when we make let's say eye contact or physical contact or anything that connects us in some type of way. I just feel these butterflies in my stomach which make me feel really cozy and protected. Also when I am not with him I always want to meet him again. And that encourages me to go to school every day with a smile on my faces, cuz I know I am going to see him and be with him all day. Ok, I am just going to stop, because I can talk about him all day and lets just say that I really like him and that I always imagine us as a couple. There is one last thing that I am going to say for him before I get to the main part. I feel like I dont deserve him. He just looks soo cute and hot and he is really sweet when he is talking with me or my friends. And when I think that I dont have a perfect body, I dont have a good looking face, my voice sounds kinda annoying... I think that when I stand up next to him people would think that we dont look good together and that I am ruining everything. But most of the times he distracts me from these type of thoughts with his smile and voice. Because I feel like I am not in a good physical form I really try to be sweet and energetic and helpful and kind and funny with everybody. I just think that if I am not going to be good at how I look I should be a very good friend. Doing this is really exhausting some times, but it just gives evidence to myself that I am a good person which makes me feel great and as I mentioned, just seeing his smile makes me feel like I can do anything. I can't think of another way to say this so I am just going to add that I like doing this, I like helping my friends and making them laugh and giving them energy, I dont want it to sound like I only do this to make people think I am a good friend. Ok, so let's finally get to the main part. So, I had to stay at home for about three weeks and not go to school, because of some health issues which are now solved and next week I will be able to go back to my normal life. Anyway for these three weeks I have been missing AALL my friends soo much. Especially the guy that I like. I just wanted to see them all and chat with them for like hours. I have been waiting for this moment for three weeks. At some point I just texted them that I miss them so much and that now I can go out. So we decided to go to the movies and then go around the city and talk. We went to avengers end game. The meet happened today. So we went to the movies and couldn't really talk, because I was busy organizing tickets and everything. I double checked if everybody is here and then we went to the movie. It was three hours long and when we got out it was about 6 o clock. Me the straight guy and two girls from our school decided to have a walk in the nearby park, because everyone else had other work and had to go after the movie. It is one of the biggest parks in our city. We went there and we talked, we laughed and everything. We had a really great time, but when we split and everyone went home I felt like the time wasn't enough. I just wanted to be with them all night and the next day too. But it is Easter and everyone is going in the country side. So I can't meet them for another 5 days. And because I just could not wait this long I decided to go to school earlier. And now as I am at home I just have this really strong desire to just hug him and hug him and hug him for hours. So I start thinking why didnt I do that. What can I do to hug him and not make him feel weird. He has not shown me any kind of sign that he likes me or anything, but I think today he was excited to see me too. All of these thoughts go through my mind and I am just confused what to do. I just really want to show him my feelings, but at the same time I dont want him to get scared and to ruin our whole friendship. I just don't know what to do. Should I tell him I am gay, but how. This could freak him out too. Will he understand that I am still the same person. Is there any chance that he will react positively. All of these questions go through my mind and I am just confused. This is not the first time I feel this way. When it happens I just try to think that I will see him soon and that he will make me feel good. I just need somebody to tell me what to do, cuz there is so much stuff to think about that our relationship just seems impossible, but at the same time I am optimistic about it. Sorry if the whole text is messed up and doesn't make good sense. I just needed to throw all of this somewhere. And it is like 1 am so I probably made a lot of mistakes writing this.

For example, I had my second maths mock today and literally cried my way through the exam. I was in my own room so it wasn't awkward or anything but still. I don't know if it was just stress or what. Or maybe it's because I got a U in my last one but I was fine for the whole day until before an hour before it when I literally started panicking despite revising and living in the college library. It's like I couldn't even comprehend the questions. I've cried so much that I feel like chundering. I tried to have a nap earlier and my heart rate just won't slow down. My eyes are sore and I feel like just giving up. Like, I feel like the only way I could've scored any worse on this test is if I literally shat on the paper and handed that in instead.

Don't get me wrong; I won't kill myself. I'm too much of a p\*\*sy for that I've got things that I really, really want to achieve in this life before I die of old age and leave a fat old family behind me with so much money that they'll be able to figure out to buy happiness. Even that seems like it won't happen since I think I might be asexual. I just really want to reset my life and start again. Or college at the very least.

And it's not like I'm stupid too. I'm fine in class. Homework is literal piss. But as soon as I sit down for a test, I'm fucked. It's like I didn't even revise.

The exfoliative cheilitis I have has destroyed the melanin cells around my lips and it's spreading. I look like a fucking gollywog or a Jim Crow character. I don't know if other people notice it but I sure as fuck do. Not to mention my fasciculations won't take a break. Every minute I feel some kind of tremor. I get them on the soles of my feet, my back, my scalp, my forehead, all places I never used to get them. They aren't too much of a problem; they even feel kind of nice but still. I've had a headache for the past week now and my abdomen hurts when I wake up and sometimes when I move in a weird way.

I've got so many hobbies that I want to undertake and I know they would improve my life so much but I feel like I've got no motivation. I believe in the law of attraction and follow the teachings of Neville Goddard (among others) and the Bible too and felt recently that my mind was what was limiting me so I've taken up listening to affirmations as I fall asleep which definitely reset my mood but I feel that by the end of the day, despite achieving the majority of what I wanted to, that I've wasted the day away.

377,"I guess I?m gonna give this a go as I don?t feel I really have anyone else to turn to. Don?t get me wrong by the title, the pregnancy is one of the few positive things in my life at this moment in time but is also part of the strain.

So I?ll be bringing a human into the world in a few months (yay!) and while this is amazing and brings me so much joy I can?t help but feel a growing sense of overwhelming grief and uselessness. Ever since I found I was pregnant everything negative in my life just kinda intensified. I guess I?ll share a few of these things and see if anyone could maybe give me some advice or kind words, thank you in advance for reading. 

1. Life at home is a misery. Since I?m 17, I?m still living with my mum and step dad. I have two half siblings, 7 and 5. Mum is the most amazing and kind hearted person you could ever meet and had been incredibly supportive, however she is not without her flaws. She is kind of a borderline hoarder. It?s not like what you see on the tv with like dead rats in the corner and newspapers piled high, the house is clean but there?s a LOT of stuff. Things like clothes and stuffed animals and things like that she gets attached to and never gets rid of. she?s constantly buying more stuff and there?s just no room for it. It spills out into my room too, so for the 8 years that I?ve lived in this house with my mum and step dad I?ve never had a room to myself. It?s like a storage unit. 

Brother and sister have a kind heart but are really spoilt and it?s beginning to show. They don?t care about any of their stuff and their attitudes are really out of line. What breaks my heart is that they seem pretty miserable too, and they?re only kids. And most of that misery comes from my step dad.

If I had to use the word hate to describe my feelings towards anyone, it would be him. He wasn?t meant to be a dad. He?s fucking useless. Didn?t have a girlfriend til he met my Mum at the age of 30. Lived with his parents and let them do everything for him. When my mum had her first kid with him, (7 year old girl) just after giving birth the first thing he said to her was ?oh I guess we?ll try again? (he wanted a boy.) At the age of 10 I had changed one of my infant half sisters nappies before he had. As both kids have grown up he?s taken no part in actively bringing them up, he?ll do the bare essentials like feeding them in the evenings when he gets home from work.  Even that he complains about it and screams at me if I haven?t fed and dressed them by the time he gets back. He has no communication skills. His own kids mock and ignore him because they have zero respect. He?s pretty abusive too. He?s never lifted a hand to me but will verbally abuse me and make sure I know I?m not part of their perfect family.   However the kids he will hit. And not a small slap on the leg like I had as a kid, he will pick them up and smack them until they cry. 

Mum knows he?s out of order but keeps believing him when he says he?s gonna change. For 2 years they haven?t slept in the same bed as eachother because he lets the youngest sleep in their double bed with him since the kids really clingy. and mum sleeps in a bunk bed with my sister.  There?s literally no affection and she came really close to divorcing him but she backed out once again because she?s too scared to be alone and we need the financial stability, especially now. 

2. Family is fake. One of the few reasons my mum married him was because she loved his family so much. They seemed like the exact opposite to him and were absolute sweethearts to me when I was younger. However this pregnancy has brought out their true colours. His mum basically shamed me behind my back and to my mum and blamed her for it and said I?d ruined my future by having this baby and that I should have aborted. She?s caused a huge divide and none of them are the people I thought they were.

My mums parents on the other hand are amazing and have supported me, and loved me and treated me with no less affection than they had previously. I love them so fucking much and they really are the one stable thing in my life. Part of the heartache is that god is fucking cruel and we not long found out that my nan has been diagnosed with cancer. So that sucks too and has taken a big toll on my emotions. I can?t lose her.

3. My boyfriend. I feel like the whole pregnancy had brought us so much closer together, despite him not wanting me to keep it he has remained with me and supported me. However I still worry about the future of our relationship because of this. Will he come to resent us? He comes to my appointments and insists he?s gonna be there for the birth which really warms my heart and I love him for that and showing so much care, but at the same time, especially recently, he keeps reminding me he didn?t want it. I don?t know why he?s doing it, whether he?s panicking as it comes closer or there?s an underlying thing of him just not being happy about it. But he seemed fine and I don?t know why he?d be this supportive if he didn?t want it. I feel useless, like I?m going to ruin his life and he?s going to hate me. I don?t want this kid to feel unwanted because of me. 

There?s just so much going on, I also have these big exams coming up and I just haven?t revised at all for them. I don?t have anything around me that makes me want to motivate myself. I try to think how it will benefit my kid by me doing well but I just, can?t. I can?t do it anymore. I feel so stuck.

This happened in the course of a few days.

I was just doing some stuff, when I decided to snap to my friend, she responded with a picture of her in a hospital. I asked her what had happened, she responded, that she tried to commit suicide by overdosing on some medication. I was completely speechless. Then I thought, because of the stuff I had done, might be apart of the reason.

I knew she was depressed, and talked many times with her about it. About her troubles, about her cutting, and other stuff, it seemed like me talking to her helped her situation.

I met her when we had cooking class, and I think she had a thing for me, and still does. And I jad a thind for her, and still do, I really really like her, but I haven't found a moment, where I could express my feelings for her, I'm also just afraid of ruining our relationship as friends, if she didn't like me back.

Some backstory.

We had this dance for our school (here where I live, we have this school system where it was first elementary school, ages 7-13 and Upper level, ages 13-16 etc.) in upper class where it was kinda like disco/dance party, that is organized by the student council. I went there with my friends from my class, and a class below us. We had fun, danced and had cake and drinks. So when there was the first slow dance, and my lower classmate decided, that his female friend should dance with me. so we went and danced. That kinda became a thing. We danced on every slow dance (there were like 5, idk why). In between dances, I noticed my friend, that later tried to commit suicide, was just standing with her friends, they seemed lonely, especially her. I thought nothing of it at first. 

When me and the the below class friend danced, I noticed her again, she looke very anxious, and lonely, but still was with hee friends, in the edge of the dance floor. I just saw something, something in her felt off, it felt like this was apart of her reason, I should have asked her to dance, she would have had a better night, and her seeing me dance with another girl, and seeing how I didn't like her enough that I would ask her to dance. might have be the reason, or apart of the reason.

After the night, I maybe had feelings for the below class girl. The next day, I really thought about it, and decided, that it wasn't actual atraction, just in the heat of the moment stuff. The relationship between me, and the below class girl, never really became anything, and we both agreed that it wasn't anything special.

I was thinking about her (my friend who is currently in the hospital), and thought about what I had done. I felt bad, but even more bad, when she sent the picture, of her in the hospital.

We talked back and forth a bit, and I asked her if I could go see her, she said she we ask the nurses, and will tell me if it's possible.

After we talked, I pieced everything together, and thought about  how my actions might have caused the suicide attempt, or be apart of the reason. I felt really terrible, and bad for her.

However, it?s been a little over a year since I broke up with my ex girlfriend because she cheated on me before I started university. Since then, I?ve not had the greatest luck with women and it?s really starting to get to me because a lot of my friends are speaking to girls and guys and are managing to build a relationship with them at university. I?ve tried going clubbing with my friends, using Tinder to meet women and DMing girls on Instagram or Twitter but I am struggling to find ANYONE who is even interested in talking to me.

I was going through the semester and barely keeping up, and eventually started falling behind. Looking forward to the final papers, I knew I couldn?t make it. I had two anxiety attacks in two days, and knew that I had to withdraw from a class to save the others. Better to get a passing grade in two classes than fail two or three.

I found out that I couldn?t withdraw without owing thousands of dollars from a scholarship. Talking to my wife and parents, they offered to help with outlines and research. It?s helpful, but it?s not enough.

I do some research, and find out that I will not owe anything if I fail the class. I also will not be in academic probation because my GPA is otherwise high enough.

387,"I've never been real close to my brother, especially in the past five or six years I've known him. No one in my family is close though, so I didn't think much of it. It feels more like we're all roommates who will eventually move out.

My bro never hugged me, never responded when I told him stuff like ""love you be safe"", never left his room when he was home. I never saw him around, but again, it's pretty much just me on my own in this house. It didn't look like he was going to graduate high school despite being an incredibly smart guy. I always thought he'd be the first to go to college. He didn't care when my mom screamed at him, never cried, wasn't really home much.

In the span of a few weeks last December, his life sorta came crumbling down. The school counselor called our parents. I don't know what she told them. No one tells me anything and I'm just trying to keep my head down and not intrude in other people's business. I'm barely staying afloat myself. A few days later, he started randomly crying in front of my mom while they were in the car together. I have NEVER seen this boy cry in my life. When she commented on it, he said that life had no purpose. He didn't know any of his friends even though he went out with them every night. He felt like he didn't have a connection with anyone on earth.

She was disturbed but didn't do anything. At this point, he was coming home at all hours of the night, if at all, and wouldn't tell anyone where he'd been. He did show me some mild drug paraphernalia and humblebrag about doing coke with his friends, but I know that has been going on for years since I was in middle school. I got used to his absence like everyone else's in my life.

One night a week later, he and my dad got into a fistfight, which has never happened before. My dad is a great guy and very mild mannered, so when he gets angry it's downright terrifying. My bro didn't care. He screamed at them about wanting to kill himself and went out.

He went to a psychiatrist. My mom despises shrinks and doesn't trust doctors. She mentioned that he shouldn't go, but I think some part of her was really worried for him. Not even years of disinterest and neglectful boredom could dig out the little motherly piece of her heart. I don't know what he was diagnosed with but they gave him zombie drugs and sleeping medication and told him to eat more, get brain scans and blood tests, and go to therapy. He weighed 127 lbs at 6'4"". I don't know how he was alive. I didn't realize. I don't know if people knew but didn't care. I'm not sure who he knows that would ask about his weight.

The last few months he has gotten better. He works on real cars now and knows everything there is to know about them. He's pretty obsessed with machine parts and such. He still goes out some nights but he always comes home at night. It's stupid but I can't go to sleep until I hear the door opening downstairs. I didn't realize how close I was to losing my brother in the most horrible way. Letting him slip away from me almost killed him. I didn't know any different.

I got into college today. Gonna be the first one in my family to go. First thing he said to me was: ""[my college]? I read an article this morning that said that was number one worst in the US."" I laughed but in reality I felt like shit. I'd been working my ass off grinding for the SAT, taking overload of classes that kept me up all hours of the night, running miles in XC, writing damn novels for Model UN, and every other bit of grinding for college admissions. I'd graduated two years early, gotten my diploma, been accepted into a great college all by myself. No one in my family really knows what I'm up to or where I'm going. I was so excited to tell SOMEONE that I made it and all he did was tell me that.

So I sucked it up and went to get a snack from the kitchen. He walked with me and he told me, ""That's cool though, congrats."" He let me hug him although he kept his arms down at his sides. I hadn't hugged him in YEARS. I haven't hugged anyone in years because although I have friends, it's weird to hug your friends. It felt so good, like some bit of him was shining through. I forgot what he was truly like.

I'm leaving for college now and I won't see him for a few years. Maybe for a really long time, depending on how things go. He won't call and I don't think I will either. What would we talk about? I might stick around this summer so I can be around him a bit more before we part ways.

I feel love for him but everyone around me is so stiflingly apathetic. I just feel lost. I want a human connection.

I was so dumbfounded at her reaction, I have a job so I can afford to buy things I need or want, that's the point of having a job. I'm fairly certain she (A) would never steal from anyone. We have had a handful of past accusations, I assume from customers who just wanted a way out of their contracts with our company, as they've never followed through with proof, police, or lawyers. Just service cancellation.


Co-worker (A) always has some backhanded response to say to me, especially when we're alone. She makes it a point to tell me how to do my job, when I'm one of the three that trained her. We've had to go back to a job just because SHE missed a spot in an area that was hers, and it was clearly visible. I hardly ever point out her mistakes, when I do it's to say ""hey, Idk if you can see it from that angle, but from where I'm standing i can see (insert what and where)"" I usually just fix it when I see it, in my opinion that's the point of teamwork and being a team player, plus I don't want her to feel like I don't trust her to do her job. She makes comments that I take too long when I'm working, yet she'll have plenty left to do while I'm finishing up my work and checking over myself, occasionally she pawns her leftover work on me and takes over what I'm doing which is our end process. We are supposed to finish our separate tasks and finish up. There are some instances where she does one area of her tasks, I do mine, the rest of hers, because she rather get a jump on the finishing up bit. It drives me insane. Why can't you just do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it?!



The best part though, the boss doesn't know, well the boss might expect it, just because (boss) has made a single comment to me before about this co-worker A. Some of the other co-workers have also made comments about this co-worker, but I don't respond to them, because when it comes down to it, I still have to work with her. I don't like confrontation and I've been holding all of this in for so long. Well until a couple days ago,  I worked with another coworker (B), one on one, her and I are a bit closer in age, and confide in each other every now and then as we both have depression. We spoke a lot. Come to find out that same coworker (A) has been making remarks about her too, completely throwing her (B) under the bus when she's not even around to defend herself.



One of the upper management workers even told me, to my face ""you're so sweet, I love you, but (co-worker A) I hate her! Idk why, but I can't stand her!""


It just feels like co-worker A is manipulative, her way or the highway type of persona, and it makes me feel crazy, even though I've personally heard it from at least 5 people (since December 2018 alone!) that they ""get a weird vibe from her"" and one (not the upper management worker) said ""I'm not too sure about co-worker A""

It was my first ""real"" job out of school and I'm pretty sure its the root cause of all my low self-esteem and everything, minus things I have listed before. This week almost did me in. I come to work Monday evening and there is already a crisis with a missing sample we needed as soon as possible. I was given the task of finding the simple in the walk in fridge. We needed it like ASAP and I spent an hour putting everything on carts looking for it...turns out it was in the wrong spot. Fucking idiots from the day shift. I had to put everything back as well. Took almost 7 hours of my shift to do. I than had to write another two hour incident report of what all happened since this was a major event as it delayed patient care so long. Finally after almost 10 hours I get home and crash hard already dreading the next day. Alarm goes off to the same..slept till almost 2..never do that. I get to work and surprise surprise we have an internal audit which we get every year or so. This includes watching things like releasing patient results really any of our daily tasks. Well it gets better, I get extremely nervous being watched and guess who they picked to watch, me! So I had to go print our procedure for the task (which I do daily) but when you're getting audited... everything has to be perfect. So the specific task they wanted to see me do was maintenance on one of our automation devices which is usually a simple and quick thing. I just pull the front panels off this calibrator, swab for dust and put it back and sign I did it on the daily log. SO yeah I printed the procedure and was following it word for word. All of a sudden the auditor stops me and told me I forgot to sign the initial and date section when the task was completed. Its called concurrent documentation, you literally have to check the task when its complete and this was the last step and I forgot to freaking check it and initial it. Well I got written for ""being observed breaking procedure due to unsigned date, signature and check box which violates procedure when it comes to concurrent documentation"". I now have to attend this meeting next week to discuss why I broke procedure. Its normally not a big deal and would be considered clerical but because it was observed by an auditor its a bigger deal. SO that happened all before my day even started. Another crazy shift and again, last hour I find a huge mistake another lab tech made and could have been a huge problem if not caught...was required to write these things up...I went and grabbed the individual and the person was virtually begging me not to write her up as she was already performing poorly. It was really up to me because I could just cut it off and not say anything and no one would notice. Only the two of us would know. She begged me for like 20 minutes as I was pacing back and forth trying to think about what to do. I finally just said fine cut the tag off and walked away. That all happened it two days, I just feel so horrible about what I did because now I sacrificed patient safety over tech cover up.. In the rush, I didn't want her to get in trouble because I know she is trying, it wasn't a huge thing...basically if anyone finds out what the both of us did we will both get fired. I am guilt ridden, angered at being written up and just the overall pressure I feel at that this place daily. Its soul draining.

In a nutshell my Husband lost his job several months ago and things have been really tight. To the point of counting change to keep our basic utilities on (electric, gas, rent) and keep our animals fed and cared for - they come first in our eyes <3 

However, my Husband started a new job a couple of weeks ago and things are finally looking up, he was told today he?s going to get a raise and more hours too! But we are still barely scraping by because obviously first couple of paychecks were small. 

Today went to the store and spent the last $15 dollars till payday (tomorrow) on dog & cat food for our animals. And had $4.00 left over to throw in the gas tank. But when I got out of the car at the gas station I realized I must have dropped 2 dollars some where but the odds of finding it or getting it back are slim especially if I dropped it in a parking lot. So I found .50 cents in the car and figured well a gallon of gas should be just enough till he gets paid. I work for myself doing house cleaning (just started my own business) but $ from that isn?t consistent it all depends on how many houses I do that week and what I do. 

When I went out to pump the gas the attendant let me know another customer threw in a few more dollars. I know that it doesn?t seem like that big of a deal but Im not the type to ask for a hand out or look for sympathy from others, our mess isn?t their responsibility. But that simple gesture meant more than the man that threw in the extra few dollars knows.... He was truly our guardian angel in disguise and lifted a huge worry off my shoulders. 

I did go back in and thank him for doing that but I feel like that wasn?t enough. Maybe through the powers of Redditors he might see this and I just wanted to say thank you again to him - You were a complete stranger and did this out of the kindness of his heart. Because of you I didn?t have anxiety all night worrying if I would have just enough gas or would I end up stranded on the side of the road. You restored my faith in humanity...

When I told my mother that I didn?t want to go to his house and help him, I was beaten. When I left a condom in his bed to try and get help after telling on me to my parents that I had broken something and their subsequent punishment, he took me to the woods and made me swallow it before leaving me to walk back. My mother?s mental health started to deteriorate, she attempted suicide many times, I had to watch her attempts whilst being told it is my fault or clean up the blood. I was neglected, I started to steal leftovers from the restaurant after people had left their plates. The staff stared silently but mercifully didn?t say anything. Due to concerns raised by the school and my mother?s admittance to the hospital, I went to foster care. I was well behaved, desperate for attention and affection.

Of course he told me what to wear, he cared about me, of course, he was entitled to pleasure when he wanted, he saved me. At age 18 we were married, at 19 I was pregnant, and at 20 I was pregnant again. Then his behaviour became overtly abusive, controlling the amount of petrol in the car so I could only do the school run, no access to money or freedom, emotionally whipping me. I began to lose myself in World of Warcraft, I made friends with a few people, had a little hope that I was part of a world that actually accepted me. He split up with me when he got together with his now wife, the person I called in tears just hoping that she could make him happy because I was never good enough.

409,"(25m) I?m coming up on 5 months since my Fianc? that I was with for two years bailed on me for another guy. We were very close, and the amount of hardships we went through together pulled us much tighter than what a normal two year relationship would normally be like (close family deaths, health issues, and other big stressors). I really was planning on spending the rest of my life with her. I meant it when I said that I didn?t want to be with anyone else, just her. Long story short, she left me for another guy. It totally blindsided me. I know within my conscience I was the best partner that I could be. I spent a lot of time consoling her, helping fix up her dead parents estate and cleaning out their hoarding junk. I was never abusive, verbally or otherwise. I poured everything I had into her, even while dealing with some of my own tragedies. So I know that there?s no reason to look back. I need to move forward with my life. I do like sex a lot. I?ve never really been a hookup guy, but I?m definitely not ready for any serious commitments. There?s a good chance I?ll be able to hookup with someone this weekend. I want to do it, but I?m honestly a little nervous about what emotions are going to come out, since this will be the first time since my Ex fianc?.",0,1556295655.0,bho7i7,2,offmychest

411,My best friend and I lived together for 8 years. When I moved out to start a life with my future husband she moved too. Her place couldn?t take dogs. So I took her dog in. All was perfect the first two years but then my husband got tired of the dogs antics. It was time to give him up to save my marriage. My friend was still not in a position to take him back. I found him a home but after a year they could not handle his antics either. They talked to my husband who told them not to tell me. The microchip is still linked to my friend so she got the call from the spca. My husband has said we can take him back temporarily so I asked my friend what she wants to do. In the end we decided to leave him at the spca in hopes to find his forever home. I feel like a shitty friend.

My ex girlfriend( we will refer to her as M) and I have been together for seven years and throughout these years we would be on and off again but those were as breaks and not as break ups and we always checked on each other and chat up a bit every few days. On the end of 2017 she was posting on her IG stories about love and her being hurt, I messaged her what she was talking about and that it?d be better if she?d talk to me about it.  She told me that we needed to take some break and I respected that and weeks later she told me we needed to break up and when asked for reasons she mentioned some old arguments that we?ve already solved and I tried to reason but it was to no avail so I thought this can?t be that serious and thought it was one of our on and offs. 

I?d check her WhatsApp and she?d keep changing her profile pictures to pictures of here which were pretty ones and mostly pictures that define her body(you know them attractive poses) and some that were of her thighs, before she only used to change her profile picture after months and they?d be casual pictures of her face or random images from the internet. A week has passed and I?ve not heard from her but the pictures were being updated almost every two to three days so I called her and I asked her if this was really the end of us and she said yes and that I?ve to move on and I asked her if she did and she said she did move on, so I respected that and let her be. She removed me from her social media followers (except WhatsApp because she hates blocking) and that?s when I realised that that was the end of us. The arbitrary break up didn?t make sense to me so I went and asked her if she was talking to anyone, she said no and I asked her if she was dating anyone to which she said no and that I?ve to stop talking to her and move on. So I stopped talking to her.  


M had a public account and a private account. She only uses the private account with her girl friends, even her male best friend is not accepted there. Two weeks had passed since she called things out and I decided to check her IG to see how she was doing and one comment caught my eyes and it was a new guy she never mentioned and he complimenting her which is nothing but something felt fishy about it and I went to his profile and looked up his followings and he was following her Private account. I guessed she had already moved on and started dating him. Told my friends that that might have been planned beforehand and they told me I?m exaggerating and she can?t do that. After a month, right before me going to sleep she texted me around 1 am (she only stays up this late to talk on video calls) saying if she can please talk to me and I told her she can. I?ll change up the format so it?d be easier for you guys to read:

Her: I did something wrong and I don?t think you?ll forgive me for it

Me: If you want to tell me, tell me most probably I?d forgive you 

Her: I was dating a guy and I think he?s mentally ill (and goes on to tell me about him and the stories and asks me how to avoid him)

Me: (gave her some advices and tips) and asked her when they started dating..?

She mentioned the day, and that day was before I asked her if she was talking to anyone.

Me: So when I asked you about that, you lied to me?

Her: Yes

Me: You didn?t have to lie, why did you jump into a relationship real quick though? Rebound?

Her: No, he made me feel special

After that I started blaming myself because I was going through lots of stress due to long-awaited finals and that way I might?ve gave her less attention.


We got back together I don?t remember how and we both were happy like before she started to change negatively and this led to us not being happy like before and I talked to her about us and that we need to do better and she?d just ignore that as if it wasn?t important. Weeks later she called things off just like how we used to do years ago. Months later I texted her asking her if she?d still want us together then we must start improving everything from now because later on she might not be able as I was going abroad. She dismissed that as it meant nothing. I still kept telling her about it and how important it was if she still wanted us together, but no she?d not agree to it and she?d not disagree with it. We?d still behave as we were together though, nothing strange.

Two months later I?m away from and her birthday was approaching so I made her a present and to make it fun I made some steps that she has to follow which would lead her to the present. Guys I?m not exaggerating but that was the cutest and most creative thing I?ve ever done and heard about.  I didn?t tell her that they?d lead to the present though, I never mentioned her birthday for months so she?d think I forgot and later be surprised by the present. I kept reminding her to do them a week earlier and when the day came I reminded her again and she said she?d make sure to do them. 


She was out the whole day celebrating her birthday and I decided to hang out with my friends. I received a text from her and I thought it?d be her being happy about the present but instead she was angry that I hadn?t wished her HBD, I asked her if she did what I told her to do, she said she didn?t and I asked her why and her reason was because she forgot and then I told her if she had not forgotten she would?ve seen that I didn?t forget her birthday(I never did, she forgot mine three times). It doesn?t end there, she said I should?ve thought about ?what if she had forgotten to check?. I know for fact it wasn?t because she forgot, it was because she never listens to me.

I broke down today. After everything I have been through and today it was finally too much. Today all the therapy and medications just couldn't keep it at bay any longer. 

&#x200B;

I've been raised by an abusive mother and step-father. I have an achingly distant relationship with my father that I have tried to remedy in the past but to no avail. I didn't go to college and use my gift of learning to its full advantage. I have instead decided to fill the void of feeling unworthy and unloved by pleasing others. This has led to further despair. Now I am a doormat. I feel so insignificant even in my daily life of being a spouse, parent, and employee. I have had success with marriage and parenting, yes. Maybe that's why I have always repressed what is now bursting forth because I feel like others have it worse. So I have no right to this pain.

&#x200B;

I have come so far, yet still filled with so much anger and pain. My mother doesn't love me. My father likes to be alone. I have lost so many friends, new and old. My job is nothing fulfilling and daily I feel like I am 13, emotionally and perceptively. Whenever I speak I am ridiculed, ignored, or yelled at. It sounds like an exaggeration, I know. But it's the truth. I am treated as nothing. An unimportant child. Even by strangers on the internet.

&#x200B;

The things I enjoy and love are ridiculed. So I feel stupid. Standing up for myself doesn't work as it leads to scorn or humiliation.  I am always ordered around and told what to do. Nobody, not even my nephews who I happen to be watching tonight (begrudgingly) listen to me. There is something about me that is so flawed. There must be. When I look inward, I see a kind and loyal person. I truly don't want to hurt anyone and often just want to help. Yet nobody outside my spouse seems to care or accept me.

It was a stupid song that finally did it. I just crumbled to my knees and cried so hard I got dizzy. I thought of all the talent of words and writing I wish I had so I could express myself fully. I thought of my envy of writers and musicians. And I just cried for hours. I am so lonely and in pain. I am rejected by everyone I've talked to for my hobbies, likes, demeanor, or true self.  I don't know who else to be. I don't know what they want me to like and not like. I don't know what is acceptable in their eyes anymore.  But I can't pretend. This is me. All soft-hearted, shy, loving, hopelessly romantic me. And I just want to be accepted.

Dear Philly,

I've spent 5 years of my life living here and I  can't stand you any longer. People seem to think that you're this delightful town, rich in cultural and historical significance. But I know the truth...that you're  actually a landfill cleverly disguised as a place suitable for human  habitation. Lemme just take a moment to list everything about you that  everyone should know before they even consider driving past you on 95  while they're making their way to a better place.

1. **Your murals are detestably bad.**  I don't know what kind of satanic blood sacrifice MuralArts had to do in order to get their stranglehold on the mural rights here, but jesus christ they straight up ruin my day with how shitty they are. If i have  to see one more mural of some asshole looking hopefully at the sky or  planting a tree, I'm going to splatter it with red paint. Here's a crazy  idea...how about you hire actual artists to paint shit that doesn't fit into the ""hopeful for the future because the present fucking sucks"" theme? I pass the stupid Kevin Hart ""live laugh love"" mural every day and it makes me hate myself for moving here.
2. **You are just covered in garbage.**  You are by far the filthiest town I've ever seen. The littering culture  here is astounding, with people going OUT OF THEIR WAY to throw their  garbage down the storm drains...Not that they really need to anyway  since you lack any semblance of a street sweeping program and the  garbage ALWAYS finds its way into the watershed. Part of my job is to teach people gardening, and every time we meet we have to devote 25 mins  to checking the ground for heroin needles and full on bags of garbage. I've seen someone scold his little brother for littering on the  basketball court (hooray!) only to then tell him to throw his trash into  the street instead (aw..) I give it 5 years before Philadelphians go full Victorian-era London and just start dumping their shit out of their  windows.
3. **You fetishize your own shittiness.**  I swear to god people here have mass-Stockholm Syndrome. I can't count  how many times I've heard some dipshit say something to the effect of  DURRRR WE MIGHT NOT BE PRETTY BUT WE'RE BLUE COLLAR AND WE GOT HEART DURRRR. Newsflash! You can be a respectable blue collar town while  trying to actually improve your quality of life. You can take pride in  where you come from while ALSO acknowledging its debilitating problems  and working to solve them. An endless parade of homeless addicts and  billowing trash does not equal ""having heart."" It just means I can't  walk around town with my visiting family without them getting concerned about what direction my life is going.
4. **Your food sucks.**  Sorry to be the one to break this to you, and I know it may come as a  shock, but warmed up pretzels and stupid cheesy sandwiches are not cool foods. People been doing that shit everywhere for approximately one trillion years. Of all the city-specific foods, yours are by far the  god damn stupidest. Any other town has at least ONE amazing food that  people should actually be proud of. San Diego has incredible Mexican   and seafood, KC has legendary BBQ, New York has insanely good and cheap  pizza, Baltimore has steamed crabs, and you dumped shitty cheese on a meat. Fuck you.
5. **Your roads dude...**  Jesus tits every time I drive to work I feel like I'm navigating the  pummeled surface of Earth's moon. I've murdered my car on the same  stretches of road so many times that I've started to give the potholes  names. Don't fill them in at this point; I've grown too attached.
6. **The ""Love"" statue**  I just can't help but imagine the amount of time and money spent trying  to figure out what sort of amazing art or statue you're going to  display at the heart of the city in the middle of its most accessible  plaza. You're sweating out board meetings, voting on countless  submissions, and grinding away because you know art is important and  this is something that people are going to see for years to come.  Suddenly some dick in the back of the room raises a trembling hand and  goes ""what if its like...the word love but we rotate the O like 20  degrees..?"" You all erupt in cheers and take turns suckling his limp,  feeble penis because you think the best kind of art for the center of  your city is something that is entirely unoffensive and says nothing of  import.
7. **Your inhabitants are angry and weird**.  Trust me I do not mean this in an endearing way like ""aw shucks that's  just our cranky uncle Joe but he's really a sweetheart."" Nah man...you  people are fucking WEIRD and aggressive. NOT in a cool way. I saw a dude  absolutely lay on his horn because he was trying to make a right turn  and an elderly woman had the AUDACITY to use the crosswalk. I was in  Wawa's yesterday, and this old lady straight up said ""I hate those  f\*\*\*\*ts that be playin sports with normal people. I hope those f\*\*\*\*ts all die."" and 5  other people chimed in with ""You know that's right DURR"" You riot when  you're mad, you riot when you're happy, and you will straight up gouge  someone with a broken Yuengling bottle if they dare insult your precious  fucking eagles. It's sports man... fucking chill. You're a bizarre, unhappy people and you project your city's many failures onto others.

I  could go on, but I can feel my blood pressure doing mean things to my  heart. I hate you, Philly, and you deserve the inferiority complex you  have because you are, in fact, inferior. Inferior to other cities,  inferior to spiders, inferior to everything. Your sister city should be Fallujah at the height of American invasion. I'd wish a plague upon you except you're already rife with cockroaches and jehovahs witnesses.

I basically started working at my dream job 4 years ago ? it was a sort of demotion but better pay, and a much better chance of progressing further than my previous employment. It was a fantastic four years, we made a product that was critically successful but not financially, so come middle of 2018 we weren't in a great state, but we were all confident as we had an amazing team, the culture was fantastic ? never in my life have I ever worked somewhere where I had more friends than I did colleagues, seriously a dream job.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to six months ago, it's announced internally that we're being acquired by a MUCH larger company ? naturally, there were concerns from everyone, but management assured us that one of the deals they made was to keep the team together ? which made sense, as that's the one thing that made what we had spectacular, we just didn't have the funding to take it to the next level and become global. Everyone was happy, except my department which started to become concerned, in the fact that this massive company had their own place off-country who dealt with my area of work ? now, those concerns were rested by current management as they explained, we're all being retrained in new fields over the course of the next couple of years, as they knew us all so well, and that our jobs were just one small part of why we were at the company ? as I keep saying, it was a fantastic bunch, everyone was really talented, so they needed to keep that.

&#x200B;

So they have me work with some of the management ? which by the way, one specific task they asked me to do, I did specifically down to the finest detail, alongside an expert they hired to ensure we did it correctly, just to have said management to completely delete my progress, redo it his way, and expect me to present it the next day... I'm given some further responsibilities of varying degrees, that annoyingly I can't express otherwise it may become obvious as to what I do or maybe even where I work... frankly I was becoming a massive asset to the company.

&#x200B;

Cut to a few days ago and I get pulled into a meeting by my boss, along with a load of other people, who could barely look us in the eye to tell us we're all being made redundant. Frankly, none of us could believe it, and I'm so fucking angry because somewhere along the chain of command, someone has been lying ? I spoke to him, HR, numerous other people saying when we were taken over ?I'm concerned about being let go?, constantly assured this won't be the case ? the fact is, I had multiple offers during this time for work, and I turned it down because I was being told we were a valued department regardless.

&#x200B;

But it's my fault ? I found this place, I loved it too much, I believed in their bullshit forgetting that at the end of the day, it's a company, it's a business. I never should have trusted anyone there, and here I am now trying to piece together my fucking CV because some assholes from outside decide that despite my massive contribution to the company the last 6 months, I'm dead weight.

&#x200B;

That's a detail I left out, I'm 99% sure this decision is off the back of the two new management that came with the company who bought us ? they completely misunderstand what makes us who we are, and the product will fail, because they're going to end up with this souless piece of shit that will nowhere near resemble what the team is capable of ? they've hired so many management and mid-level managers that are fucking snakes and sharks ? either there to twist the knife or show you it before they strike, it's fucking horrendous and frankly could end up being one of the best things that happens to me, being let go.

&#x200B;

And what's frustrating is, it's not like I'm totally fucked ? I've had a LOT of offers, as I've been in this industry for over a decade, and I'm REALLY good at what I do, it's just that the wound is fresh and I fucking hate that I have to say goodbye to the second best thing that happened to me, behind meeting my wife.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I don't even swear this much normally, it's just that this seems like the most appropriate time for it.

&#x200B;

So as I say, I'm home alone right now, updating my CV to send to the dozens of places who've contacted me, but frankly all I want to do is cry ? I thought I was okay, as I've had a day and a half since it happened, but today my wife is back at work, so it's the true test of being alone, and I'm close to fucking destroying everything in sight. I hate this, I want to tell everyone this but I can't, for fear of completely destroying my career ? even writing this post there's a slight chance it might catch the eye of the wrong person who puts two and two together, but I don't care, I need to fucking say something to someone, even if it's anonymously to strangers, who frankly might not even read it just based on the sheer length and rambly nature of this.

429,"My great aunt (my grans sister) has been a widow for the past 3 years. For a year before her husband died, he was very ill and we as a family stepped up to help them, taking them to appointments, taking them out shopping and to places like the garden centre if they wanted. They did not have any children of their own and so it fell to us. After he died we knew that she would depend on us more and we were prepared for that. We continued on visiting her everyday as she had medication that she said she couldn?t administer herself (we knew this was a lie but thought she would eventually stop) and this continued on for two years. We never received any thanks for helping her or any acknowledgment that we were going out of our way to help, which made some of us resentful as she expected us to take time off work regularly to help her. She has never had a job and so doesn?t understand what it?s like when you have to work to afford food/a house etc.

Then my grandad became unwell and ended up in hospital for a few weeks. During this time my gran didn?t go to visit my great aunt as she was too tired after visiting my grandad in the hospital. However my mother and myself still visited her a couple of times a week and made sure she attended any appointments she had and that she went shopping. We even arranged for a carer to go and administer her medication however she then miraculously became able to do it herself again ?. My great aunt did not like that she was not getting as much attention and so began to be very abusive towards my gran over the phone, telling her that my grandad was going to die and that we deserved it because we are ?horrible people?. She also began to hurl abuse at each of us when we visited her to take her out and she would constantly complain about us behind each other?s backs. Her favourite line was ?you?re not a real family?. 
My grandad thankfully made a full recovery and was able to come home, however, we were reluctant to go back to visiting my great aunt everyday after what she had said about us all. 

Now, years later, she continues to ring my gran everyday, saying things to upset her on purpose and regularly making her cry. She tells her that everyone she talks to thinks she?s an awful person, that their mother would be ashamed of her and things like this. No matter how much we tell my gran to ignore what she says and to hang up the phone my gran won?t because she feels guilty. It?s making my gran ill and her health is not great anyway. We are worried that the constant verbal abuse might have some serious consequences for our gran but cannot find a way to make my great aunt stop. We tried visiting her more regularly, taking her to visit friends, organising for her to attend groups with people her age but she either refuses to go ?because it?s beneath her? or she goes and just finds something to complain about anyway. We just can?t win.

Dunno how long this will be. Today I finally received an offer for a tech job. I feel like crying because I've been living a lie to everyone. Close friends, family, strangers, acquaintances, literally everyone. Everyone thinks I graduated with a degree in CS last year and that I've been working since the fall. What actually happened was for my junior and senior I bombed every course. Did not put in effort when things got hard. My laziness and failure kept feeding into my insecurity that even if I did try I would fail anyways so what's the point.

After ""graduation"", I was desperate to get a job. I signed up a coding bootcamp that didn't make you pay upfront because I figured I had enough coding/computer science knowledge to do well. I just didn't know how to actually \*\*\*MAKE\*\*\* something. I did not have any friends after graduation because I did not have enough money to go out to eat or drink all the time like my other friends with full-time jobs. I had some money saved from part time work during college, so I used that to make it seem like I wasn't deadbeat. During the summer, I told everyone that I would be starting my job in the fall. I was actually going to be enrolled in a coding bootcamp until February. This was my ""training"" for my new job.

I know some people look down on coding bootcamp, but it was a great experience. Here I didn't have to lie to anyone about who I was or what I'm doing. It taught me to be confident in my work again and not to be afraid to fail when I'm creating. But when bootcamp was over, I had to face reality again. I still had no job. Bootcamp took 60+ hours of my week and now I had more time to myself than I knew what to do with. I started applying like mad. I applied to every entry level position I could find. During this time I still lied about where I was working. Claiming that I was ""working remotely"" when I really was just applying to find a job. I thought maybe once I got one, I could return to normal and everything would be ok.

Yesterday i [18] broke up with my first girlfriend who I dated for over two years and it?s honestly excruciating. To lose the person that you text when you find something funny or interesting or just have something on your mind is the worst feeling. The worst part is that there wasn?t a big dramatic reason for us to separate. She lost feelings and felt that it was time to move on. Albeit the last ~6 months of our relationship was rocky and neither of us were extremely happy, it?s so hard to think i?ll never be with her the same way again. 

Anyway... 

My mom has been amazing. She?s been here for me 24/7 to make sure that I keep busy and have a shoulder to cry on when i need to. She cries with me and knows all the right things to cheer me up and i just can?t express enough how much i appreciate her.

At 15 I felt like I had singlehandedly destroyed my family. My father wasn?t apart of my life so my stepdad was the only father figure I had. I started calling him dad when I was 6.

The reason I worry isn't because she gives them money (although that has caused some weird situations before) because I understand that, I worry because she will let just about anyone into her car if they say they need a ride and I really don't understand how she thinks that's a good idea and especially how she's even able to allow herself to do that because of her problems with anxiety.

My depression starts. I wake up and feel like have been hit by truck. Everything hurts, my back, my neck, my shoulders feel like a million pounds. My brain is foggy and can't comperhend anything being said to me. Noises make my skin crawl, and make me loss my temper. As the days go by it only gets worse. 

My brain decides to replay past memories. Not of abuse or anything like that. It replays confrontational moments in my life, where I felt bad, or i did something wrong. This memories can range from happening just a few minutes ago to as far back as 10 (im 32). They are constant all day every day. After I see these memories in my head, i come out of them and tell myself I am idiot, a worthless humen being. It gets to the point where all i think about is how horrible of a person I am. That everyone hates me and they would be better off without me. I am an awful mother, my kids would be better without me. My husband would be off without me. My friends, my parents, my siblings,  other mothers i interact with, all think i am a horrible human being. My brain does this over and over agin till i get the next point. 

The wanting to die. My brain continues to do this, but it added a step. It gives me ways to die. That cutting myself will make me feel better. That killing myself  is the only way to make the people around me better. They are better off without me, because i am a worthless peice of crap. The brain contemplates how i will do it. Do i drink some wine and take a bottle of pills, do i cut my wrist then take a bath, do i drive my car off a cliff or into tree. It does this for weeks. You are so emotionally exhausted, you try everything to make your brain stop. Diets , massive amounts of medications, pot, alchohol, therapy.  Nothing works for more then a moment. At this point you can do nothing, but ride it out and hope that one morning you will wake up and feel better. 

People who commit suicide, we as society call them weak.  They are not weak,  they are tired. Tired of feeling this way,  tired of not feeling well, tired of feeling like they have been run over, tired off feeling like world hates them. They have been run over by their brain.

I love that people share the suicide hotline. Althought many people on that path will not call. Their emotions are hard to talk about, mainly because they have no solid reason to feel this way. Share that hotline but do this. If you know someone might be depressed, or their behavior has changed; isolating them self, telling you they are too busy or dont feel like it. Tell these people (and all the ones you love), that they are wanted they are loved, they have a purpose in life. They are not supid, the world does not hate them, and that you love them and care for them not matter what. Hopefully when more people reach out and we can stop suicide in its tracks.

Both girls names start with ?A?, and the both are complete opposites. So girl number 1 was my first love, and we dated in middle school for two years. Got into high school and broke up. Sophomore year started, I got with girl number 2. She was great, proclaimed she was a ?virgin? and my teenage mind thought jackpot lock it in. So I got to know her in every way I could so I could fit her mold of the man she wanted. Then girl number 1 came back, and I fiddled around with her too. Why not? Well I end up breaking up with girl number 2, and fuck her best friend to get her to leave me alone because she?s gotten to attached. Junior year starts, I start dating girl number 1 again exclusively. But this entire time girl number 2 stayed around. And supposedly had this birth control device that?s up inside her cervix/uterus(I?m not sure sorry). Well about 2 weeks before I started dating girl number 1 again, we found out girl number 2 is pregnant. I panicked, I ignored it and I blocked out girl number 2. Well eventually girl number 1 found out and I acted like I had no idea and she felt even worse that I found out through her. Girl number 2 is about 6 months pregnant, and I start going back and forth between both girls exclusively. It made me look like shit, it was bad. It was like a reality tv show. But I honestly just found both of them attractive and wanted both of them but they hate each other(obviously). So then girl number 1 is pregnant. Girl number two has my son in February. Out of impulse of winning a big jackpot at a casino, I buy and engagement ring for girl number 2. Then I say never mind but she keeps the ring because she says it?s the nicest thing I?ve given her( I still continue to go back and forth after this). Girl number 1 has my son in August on the day I start college. Girl number 1?s family hates me and filed restraining orders and also kicks me out of hospital room when I showed up for birth. I can?t blame them. But whatever, I hire a lawyer, beat the restraining orders, and force her family to let me see him. It makes a good love story me and girl number 1 reunited. I continue going back and forth, then I find out girl number 2 sucked a guys dick at a party, I get angry and go out and fuck her best friend( different one) for a week straight, snort xanax(this was a new one for me) and get high and drunk. I totally forgot I had finals in the morning, go and pass all my finals but fail a class for my attendance. Get put on academic probation, my family is disappointed ( I got a 27 on my act and went to a community college so I thought I was capable and was gonna breeze through but this ruined my confidence) so I quit/didn?t re-enroll. Then I get back with girl number 1 and keep fiddling with girl number 2 again. Girl number 1 is completely dependent on me, living arrangement and food and transportation. Girl number 2 has her own place now, job, car and is about to get an associates degree. I work a dead end job at a casino as surveillance.

So when I was a teen (15-16) I started to touch my cousin (about 6-7), at first it was just that, touching over the clothes but then it became more than that. She was asleep most of the time since most of the visits to my house or my uncles house were at night or will extend till too late. I don't want to make this too detailed so I just want to mention that it was never violent or forced or painful (not to make it less worse, just to mention it), but I felt like crap after it and that feeling has been with me all the time since then (25 years). I feel a lot of guilt and regret, and I tried to do the right things since then, but it doesn't work like that, I know I am a bad person no matter how good people think I am.

I being reading about the subject and started to think in my childhood, it was good, but never had true validation from my brothers and parents, and I always felt dismissed, also some time ago I started to remember someone touching me when I was maybe between 11 and 14 years old. I remember this being in bed sleeping and suddenly waking up with an erection and someone rubbing me with his hand, I remember just turning around and back to sleep. It was something I tried to ignore when it happened, but now I can't. Also I remember having a strange sexual behavior as a child, I don't remember when things happened but I am guessing around when I was 6, I knew about sex and one time when I was sleeping over a friends house we started to talk about it, at some point I asked if he wanted to try it and he said yes, at some point I had pain in my penis and stopped, he wanted to continue but we went to sleep, we were good friends a few more years after that and never try it again. 

Also I remember when I was about 6-7 maybe 8 years old, when I was in elementary school, I had this classmate, I don't remember being really friends or much about him just that we were classmates, but after classes we hid in the yard on some bushes and masturbate each other.

I also remember this girl when I was about that age (6-7) but she was a bit older than me, maybe 7-8, and she kissed me and we hid from her little brother and kiss, I don't remember much of her besides that.

If you did something wrong like I did, do not try to hide it, it is the worst thing to do, if you feel sorry and you want to stop (I am sure you feel this way), try to talk to a professional. It won't clean what you did but it will stop getting worse.

My friend (who I will call Yolanda) and I were supposed to hang out yesterday.

Recently my mother had to move her mother into her home. Before then I?ve had very little contact with my grandma as I came into adulthood just phone calls every now and then. Now that she lives with my mother I visit her every afternoon after work so she doesn?t have to be alone while my mother takes an hour long drive home. ( my step father works 2ed shift so he?s here all day with her ) we mostly sit on the porch and chat. Here?s why I believe she has a mental illness and it?s not just her getting old.  
From what I?ve been told since I was a child mental illness runs in our family.

Now as an adult while I sit with her for an hour or 2 a day she says some really troubling things to me when it?s just her and I. Around other family members she?s all smiles and sweet. I find myself thinking am I crazy or did she really just tell me her biggest mistake in life was having children and she wishes she would have rid herself of them at a young age... and how if at all do I tell my mom what she says. She often gives me advice on training my children to be submissive and seen and not heard( I have no kids and I tell her this every time. ) I?ve confided in my SO about what she tells me and his advice is to not let her speak to me the way she does and put my foot down.

Exchange has been the worst experience of my life and I wouldn?t recommend doing it if you are in a relationship and plan on doing it long distance.

I don?t even know where to begin. We?ve been together for 7 months and we broke a month ago and I haven?t been able to think straight ever since. I thought that posting something on this sub would help me out in someway.

Everything before leaving for exchange (10,000km away from home) was perfect. We never had a fight, never had a single dispute, never even disagreed on anything. She was the perfect girlfriend and the thought of breaking up never even crossed my mind.

Things went to shit the moment I stepped into my exchange university. The first week was pretty overwhelming and quite disorienting, socializing and making new friends never was an easy task for me so it required my full attention. It is during this week where I think I messed up and triggered a series of unfortunate events.

The very first week I messed up 3 times:

\>One night I came back into my dorm, facetimed her and she directly told me that I had to go see her during spring break, stupid me told her that it was way too soon to make plans and that everything was a blur for me and perhaps the friends (that I hadn?t made at the time) would want to go on a trip somewhere. This really pissed her off and for the right reasons.

\>She also told me to put a picture of us as my phone wallpaper, I said yes but in reality felt awkward about doing so especially since I would meet a lot of new people I didn?t necessarily want them to look at a cute picture of us when they would look at my phone for the first time. Anyways, one day she asked me to show my phone and obviously the picture of us wasn?t there, she had a full mental breakdown and thought I was gonna cheat on her, etc? Again, I understand that I messed up on my part really thought this was out of proportion.

\>Last but not least, we both new that we would not see each other as well this summer because we had internships in different countries. We were really sad about it and I said that we would have to ?suck it up and deal with it?. That again blew out of proportion, in my opinion, and triggered her. But looking back, I realized that I should?ve not been that dry about it.

After the first week, things kinda went back to normal. We had normal conversations and thought that we would not have any more dispute. Boy was I wrong. After the first week, I had already made a solid friend group. In that friend group was this girl with a very ?mean? instagram account. My ex-gf noticed that this girl followed me on my meme-instagram (important for context) and immediately started to ask me question. I had to give a detail description of every single girl friend in my friend group, if they were single, who were their boyfriends, etc? That really stressed me out. I felt really restrained.

One night we decided to go to the beach with this friend group (3 guys 2 girls) until 1:30 am. I told my ex-gf that I would call her at 1:00 am when I come back, however we only came back at 1:30am. My ex-gf freaked the crap out because I was 30 minutes late and freaked out even more when she learned that I was there with them and accused me of going on a ?double-date?. I had to talk to her until 4 am to make her understand that these people were just friends and I only cared about her. She basically was saying that I wasn?t her first priority and that I should be giving more attention which I really believed wasn?t true at the time.

This kind of event occurred frequently. She started being agressive in the way she was texting and talking to me. She would regularly ?fake break-up? with me or say stuff like ?if you can?t handle me just leave me?. That really made me freaking sad as most of this stuff was completely out of my control. Sure I chose the wrong friend group but I really don?t think I deserved all this negativity from her.

I occasionally post memes on my meme instagram account. Every time I would post a meme, that ?mean? girl would comment on it. This was totally out of my control and I refused to tell her to stop commenting as I didn?t want her to get involve with my relationship. My ex-gf would obviously go full on mental breakdown every time this was happening. I now realize that I should have not been posting memes as this was just making things worst for us. I even had the misfortune to be in one of the story of that ?mean girl? and she cried for hours.

I was so scared of pissing her off again that I refused to go in all the trips my friend had planned because that ?mean? girl was always there.

I ended up buying a plane ticket to go see her during spring break, unfortunately she had to leave to her country of origin because of a family emergency. At this point we both knew that the relationship was over. Seeing her for spring break was the last resort to fix things between us. She started being super cold with me and we did not talk as often as we used to. She had class 8 hours a day every single day, we had 6 hours time difference so we basically never were able to talk that much.

One day she tells me that she wants to go on a study ?break?. That means that we would not be together / talk for 2 weeks. Because I really wanted her to do well on her exams I accepted it. Of course stupid me kept on talking to her. At the end of the break, she tells me that this guy asked her out on a date and she said yes and that he kissed her at the end of it. She came back to me crying and told me that she regretted everything. I obviously was pissed at her but was blinded by love (I still am) and so I decided to get back with her. 2 days later I decide to post a meme (I?m not smart) and obviously the ?mean? girl commented on it. My ex-gf had another mental breakdown. Why was I not allowed to be mad at her for going on date with some random guy while on a ?study? break but she was allowed to be mad at me for something I essentially had no control over? That really made me so angry. I told her that her going on a date with some random person just to make me jealous was a form of emotional abusive, she got super defensive and furious. She started showing me definitions of emotional abusive and how I was wrong.

I reached out to some of my friends, told them the story and they advised me to break up with her. I did it the next day and immediately regretted it. Note that at the time she had already ?broken up? with me like 5 times.

In retrospect, she was studying for exams and perhaps was over reacting due to stress. She ended up failing one exam and blamed me for it.

Long story short, my friends prohibited me from talking to her, but after two weeks I couldn?t help it and started texting her again. At that point I was really desperate and tried to ?crawl back? as best as I could. I even admit to have been manipulative in what I was saying to her in hopes that it would trigger something positive in her. She ended up telling me that I was treating her like shit, which I believe wasn?t true. That I wasn?t always there for her and that I was making her cry all the time. She said that we were too different, I?m a finance major she is a med student. I only have 2 more years in the city we?re both living in, she has 4 more years.

She told me she started dating someone three weeks ago and said that I should forget about her. This freaking broke my heart and I haven?t been able to sleep, eat well ever since. I lost 14 pounds within a month.

Spring break time comes along, I went to visit my family. She is visiting her family. We ended up being in the same city (Dubai) for 12 hours. I told her to come see me at the airport, she refused. The next day she texts me crying and says how sorry she is and that she?s a bad person,etc? I kinda regained hope and started texting her even more. This only lasted for a day, she became a cold shortly after. But I was still blinded by her initial reaction and took her mood change really personally, I essentially became even more desperate and had many many mental breakdown. I just had one today. Now she thinks that I am crazy, I?m really not. Breaking up made me realize that I perhaps had taken this relationship for granted. I told her that I was willing whatever it takes to make it work between us, that I was willing to change for the better but she refused.

What do you think I did wrong?

Maybe I should add that her past boyfriends have cheated on her so she is VERY paranoid (which I didn't know before going on exchange). Is this perhaps the root cause of all those problems?

I genuinely want to know. I really wanted to fix our relationship but she didn?t seem to be that interested in doing so. I am so heartbroken, she was my first girlfriend and losing her makes me feel like shit. I don?t know what to do anymore. She told me that I could have dinner with her in June when I come back, but now she changed her mind and never wants to see me again. I?m so sad, I?ve never felt this bad before. I cry every night just thinking on what I?ve missed out. I am going insane and would therefore appreciate any insight you guys might have.

I really want to get back with her but now I think I ruined my chances after basically begging her to get back with me for the past 2 weeks.

I told her that I would not give up on our relationship, that I would reach out again in June and if it doesn?t work that I would reach out again in September.

486,"My mother was married to her 2nd husband (also a divorcee) a little over 15 years ago, for 2 years. They were together for 6 years altogether. 


She always claimed they had 1, lone argument in the 4 years prior to getting married; something about directions when they were abroad. 2 weeks before they got married and a week before we all moved in together, he did a personality-180 and never went back. It began with emotional abuse and, suffice it to say, despite the red flags, my mother still married him. 


As a result of their disastrous marriage, including his physical abuse of my mother, my siblings and I all found our ways out and now all live on different continents. One even joined a cult, which speaks for itself. 


When they first got married, I still lived at home. After about 3 months I had to get out. One time after some physical abuse, she called the police (side note: he went berserk bc he was tangentially connected to the judicial system and was scared it would affect his position(!)), and I remember her coming to my place and sitting on the couch with me, my roommate and RM?s friends, helpless, because she?d had to escape to her kid?s house cos her husband had hit her. 

Another time, he slammed a door into her and when she went to the doctor a few days later, she refused to reveal exactly what had happened and just said she?d fallen off a ladder. I remember even calling the doctor to try and get them to put what really happened in her notes and they refused, citing that they had to hear it from her. 


The marriage lasted 2 years and when they got divorced he moved abroad. Suddenly, when they divorced, everyone and their dog remembered how he was ?difficult? and ?had a temper? etc. during his first marriage. WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU ASSHOLES BEEN HIDING??!!


I don?t think my mother ever really told many people what actually happened and although it was obvious something had gone awry, she never publicly pinned it on him, presumably bc then she?d have to admit she fucked up by marrying him, despite the warning signs. 


Anyway, cut to 2019, he died last week. Mother found out bc a relative found out through Twitter. She told him not to tell me and siblings, and he didn?t, even though he and I are close. So she ?waited? 2 days and then told us, allegedly bc she?d wanted to see it in b&w(!). 


Suffice it to say, I?m delighted that he?s dead. Couldn?t give a shit. Where does my mother get off not telling me for 2 days? Not like she found out through a ?private? source; fucking Twitter. Her reasoning is that it wouldn?t make a difference... so why not tell me?

488,"I?ve never told anyone any of this and I kind of want to get it off my mind, I?ve repressed almost all of my feelings for all of my life. I?ve always isolated myself so here?s me opening up I guess?

I was born, I spent the first three years of my childhood with only my mom. During this time she had a boyfriend,(Fuck you andy) who for some reason got joy out of torturing me. He even would try to drown me in the bathtub. My mom would go to work as she was basically a single mom with no family around really. So he would often offer to babysit me for her. The one I remember most vividly started with her leaving, like usual, but that day I missed her more than anything, I couldn?t stop myself from crying for her to come home. She was my protection. I guess he didn?t like that I was crying. Or maybe I was crying because I knew it was going to start again. He chased me around her apartment with a belt, occasionally hitting me. Until I ran into her room and kept screaming. He threw me onto her bed and slammed the door and locked it. I spent hours locked in that room. All by myself. He even left, I remember the red truck the piece of shit was driving. He only came back before my mom got home to unlock the door but for some reason I never told her about it. I guess I was scared of what would happen to me. This was the start of repressing everything. 

Fast forward. I?m four or five now. Mom finds out he?s an abusive pos but not to me, only because he was abusive to her. She gets in contact with my real dad and asks him if he would want to get back together, and be in my life not just for me but for her, because she loved him. For a while things were okay. It was cool having a dad. He would take me camping, we went golfing, played games he would even let me go to work with him and put down flooring. I developed a love for my father, just a typical father son relationship. Until it started again. I would do something to get in trouble and I would get my ass whooped with a belt, sometimes by hand. But only now do I realize maybe hitting me twenty plus times did more bad than good. During this time I still had family, before it all fell apart my cousins would come and stay. They were older than me. One who I still love dearly to this day was probably around 15 and the other one, who I hate was two years younger than him. Me being young and unknowing I guess he knew he could take advantage of that. I was raped, numerous times over the course of the weekend that he stayed. I don?t wanna go too much in detail but I didn?t really know too much as to what was happening to me. I was pretty sheltered when it came to anything sexual. I hadn?t really a clue that I was being raped or defiled in anyway. It doesn?t really bother me today, it hasn?t affected my sex life in anyway; I only wish I could torture him for what he did to me. He no longer looks at me when he sees me, which fortunately is almost never because that family lives two hours away. I only told my mom about it a couple of years ago and she?s been really good about making sure if we make plans with them that he won?t be there. But for years I had to see him and be around him at family outings and whatnot. After everything he did to me they never came to stay again. So that was over and done, but the trauma wasn?t.

I?m about 10 now. My family moved to a smaller town, with a smaller school up in a mountainous area. This was when everything really bad started to go down. We found out my father was sick, and even though he wasn?t perfect I still loved him. I spent as much time with him as I could. He was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. He was a fairly big man at around 235lbs at diagnosis. For a while they couldn?t figure out what was wrong with him. But for some reason he always insisted he was in pain. The symptoms worsen and he?s getting smaller. Was prescribed numerous pain pills, for a while it was methadone then morphine, he also had Valium and loritabs. My mom was on anxiety medication (Ativan). He would quite frequently steal them and manage to eat 45 in two days. He would always run out of morphing before his next prescription so he would start withdrawing and be absolutely vile to all of us. He tried to throw my mom off of a porch one day. Screaming at her and screaming at us. I mostly secluded myself to room and very rarely came out. But when he?d get his meds filled again the first few days he would stay so fucked up off of them that he literally thought a flip flop was a burger and was EATING crayons dipped in marinara sauce. Which honestly I find hilarious now but at the time I didn?t understand. But after he would realize he was gonna run out he would slow down on them and we?d have our ?normal? dad for a few days.. things only got worse though. It was up and down all of the time. He overdosed numerous times and getting off the bus with you 5 year old sister to find your dad foaming at the mouth really does something to your mind. He went into a psych ward for a while because they thought it was intentional. He got out and nothing changed. He was still abusing his morphine and would frequently force me and my sister to get in the car with him because he wouldn?t leave us home alone while my mom was working. I can not describe how scary it is to have someone who?s nodding off and swerving all over the roads driving you around. 

It wasn?t really until the age of 12 that I understood he was an addict with a sickness, And not my dad with a sickness. He crashed and totaled numerous cars leaving my mom with lots of debt. He ruined her credit and stole money to buy drugs with. Then we had some neighbors move in in front of us. These people were horrendous. Really big into heroine and even had two kids. They would fall asleep with cigarettes and burn their kids, dirty needles everywhere. But for some reason my dad befriended them. Everything got worse when he met some men named Archie and chuck Who he must?ve convinced himself was his friends. They weren?t. They stole his pills and would disappear for a while. Then they?d come back the next time he got them filled. They would get him so doped up he?d pass out and then steal again. So what did my dad do? He kept letting it happen. And when he had no money and no pills he would start pawning stuff. Selling it whatever he could do to get money. All of my moms jewelry. All of my games and consoles. But we weren?t rich by any means and lived paycheck to paycheck. It was just the things we had collected over the years. There?s too many times to even recall them all but all of us would be drug along with him by him to the middle of nowhere for various drug deals. My mom wanted so bad to leave him and to get us out of there. But I insisted we stay, and so did my sister because he was helpless. That was a mistake. He didn?t change and had no interest in changing. Even after we all told him we?re gonna leave if he doesn?t do something or at the least TRY. it meant nothing to him. The overdoses continued, so did the abuse and the withdrawals. He pushed all of our family away from us and we still have none of them to this day because of all the meds he stole and the stuff too. One thing I should mention is he promised all of us that he never shot up. That he would never ever shoot up. 

Finally we?ve had enough, I turn 14 and in November we give up on him. We move out and into a trailer that?s quite literally falling apart, the floors the ceilings everything like two miles away. It wasn?t much but I?ll forever be grateful for it because we didn?t have to pay rent because our ?adopted? grandpa let us stay there. My mom was bettering herself by going through nursing school and working a full time job just to provide for us. I started homeschooling because public school was way too much for me, the people, the anxiety the depression. Every time I got checked out I thought it was because my dad died, it never was, I couldn?t be that fortunate. My dad, who was still spending all of his money on drugs didn?t really seem to care. It?s like we gave him what he wanted. But only when he would sober up (which for him was taking his meds the way he was supposed) would he actually care that we didn?t want to see him. 

He had put himself in one nursing home but was kicked out because he was snorting his morphine in the bathroom or was attempting to shoot it I can?t remember. 

He moved to an extended stay motel in probably like may of 2016, this was the beginning of the end. We would stay with him once a month for two days, but he couldn?t even be normal for us two days a month. Everything would be fine during the day, then he?d go into the bathroom at nighttime for a long time and then literally crawl out and sleep on the floor. It was so terrible because sometimes he would literally shit himself in a tiny single room with only a bathroom. The whole night I would stay up to make sure he wasn?t dead with the smell of shit in the air hoping my sister wouldn?t wake up. Eventually we stopped going. And he put himself in a another nursing home around August right after his birthday. Only because I was house sitting for my grandparents, I was still only 14 but I was watching their house for a week. He was supposed to be with me. He didn?t even make it one night and had left me to go do drugs in his motel room. I didn?t say anything until after the week was up because I liked the alone time. At this point he was making an effort. He was actually trying to get better, or at least I tell myself that so I hate him less. We visited more often when he was there because we couldn?t be forced into staying for all of the bad. Then one day, August 31st we get a call saying he?s unconscious and that he was being taken to the hospital. One of the nurses had administered his insulin, which bottomed out his sugar and put him into a diabetic coma. He laid in the bed for a while before anyone noticed he wasn?t waking up. At this point he had been in and out of the hospital so many times this wasn?t new to any of us and I was quite sure he was gonna live through it. He didn?t. I spent six days in the hospital until he died on September 6th, 2016 at 3:05pm. Three days before my birthday. I watched him die. I felt so relieved. Is that bad? That I was happy he died. I still kind of am because my life has only gotten better, at least compared to what it was. I still remember the way the funeral home shook when I played the songs he wanted played, remember everything by 5FDP. 

I moved on after that. I repressed a lot of things. But one day we?re driving me, my mom and my sister. I found his old phone in the car door. With videos in them. They?re four hours long. He was documenting himself and his method of making his morphine something to shoot up. And I quote ?You?re right (mothers name) we all fucking shoot around here.? 

This pretty much killed us. Cause we had no solid evidence that he did so we never believed it until then. 

But now life is only seeming to get worse. I have a copious amount of mental issues and my mom might have cancer. And I swear if she does, and she dies..  I?ll probably kill myself honestly. If you made it this far thanks for listening... it?s kind of all over the place but there was way too much that?s happened to me.. way too much repressed and it?s kind of hard keeping everything in chronological order.. have a wonderful night people of reddit.

I don't do any sports, arts, or anything. Hell, I'm not even smart. However, I had the feeling of wanting to get involved. There were things I thought about trying like doing water polo, cheerleading, joining the orchestra, and maybe doing softball. Unfortunately, I'm not athletic and I don't play any orchestral instruments. Also, I feel like people at my school will judge me for doing these kinds of things. I feel like if I join any sports, I'll be a liability to the team. I'm literally useless to my school. I feel as though I should be having fun in high school.

*Some backstory:*  
*I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ADHD, panic attacks, Borderline, severe OCD, suicide thought and from time to time I'm suicidal. On top of all this, I'm in the middle of finding out whether I have Asperger or not. I've had addictions but I'm kind of sober. The thoughts is still there, but the actions aren't.*  
*My fiance is by my side through everything, lifts me up, make me laugh through my tears, do check ups on me each hour when he's at work if I'm having a bad period, just to know I'm still alive. He has three times during our four year relationship literally saved my life (once, he dragged me inside when I was about to jump out of the window from 3rd floor). He's amazing in every way, and I'll probably never understand how he just gets through this all, with out questioning me or my acts/feelings/behavior.*

I hit rock bottom. Again. I've lost count on how many times it has happened through my 27 year short life. I'm hurting myself, both emotionally and physically. I've been struggling to get back up on my feet for a few months, and last week I got accepted to try to work. I'll be there for two days a week, just 3-4 hours each time, and it's completely up to me to chose when I want to be there and/or not. My boss knows my difficulties and will adjust the tasks to fit me.  
However, I've had a bad period for three weeks now. I've hid it from my fiance all this time, because I don't want to bother him with my problems. Though I know he's never judged me, I'm still afraid every single day, that he will. It's impossible for me to understand that he loves me, like genuinely loves all of me, during these crash downs. Yesterday, I woke up crying. Shaking from anxiety, headache, nausea, and I was ready to just give it all up. To run out of the house and just lay down on the train tracks and end my life. For good. After a few hours in bed, I managed to crawl out if and sit my pathetic ass down in the chair in front of the computer and just look at the screen. Just stare at it, but somehow not see anything. I had my boxes of medication beside me, and the urge of overdosing was overwhelming. In the same time, the urge of cutting myself and just get rid of the most acute anxiety was there as well. Though I was a complete emotionally meltdown, I was enough ""awake"" to be able to choose between the two of them. I chose self harm. At the very moment, I'm relieved, but a few hours later, the anxiety hits again, twice the power than before, and then the shame comes creeping up through my spine like ice and fire in the same time. I'm ashamed for hurting myself. I'm ashamed that I hurt others by hurting myself. It hurts more than words can describe when I see the disappointment in mt fiance's eyes when he sees the wounds. He's not disappointed at the direct injuries, but by the fact that he wasn't there to stop me. That I chose to hurt myself instead of turning to him. I'm normally shutting down and refuse to talk to people about my problem there and then, because I don't want to be a liability to others. I don't want to drown others in my problems more than I already do, just by existing.

I was watching live pd on youtube and saw a middle aged woman get pulled over on a traffic stop. Her face was blurred but everything about the way she dressed, her stature and nervousness in the situation made me think of my mother. The cop started asking hard questions and she was clearly on edge and made the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard ""I can't talk to you anymore I have to go to the bathroom"" as a last ditch effort. I just thought my mother would probably do something like that, if it was her she wouldn't know what to do either. My mother isn't a criminal. It was evident to me that this woman wasn't a real criminal either. She was being used, and imaging if my mum was hard on her luck and ended up in that situation made me want to cry. Everything about it made me want to physically vomit. The cops seemed sad about it all too.

On the flip side I saw another guy around my age get busted with like a kilo of heroin he was moving. When the cop asked him if he had any he said he'd swallowed half a gram which could easily kill someone. Listening to the guy speak he had no attitude just sounded resigned and slightly scared. Imagining myself in his shoes I thought ""yeah if I was that guy and realised I was gonna go to prison for a long time, my options are narc on my boss or go longer, not withstanding telling my family what happened - or knowing I cost my boss a lot of money and they know I have a family...

I'm a single mom of a 8 years old sweet, yet difficult, boy. I love him deeply, he's my life, we have one another and are really close. 

I became pregnant by accident but didn't mind it because I always wanted to be a mom. My little one was born with a host of health problems, and also diagnosed within the autism spectrum at the age of 4. Things were difficult but good until about three years ago, when he started acting very defiantly, having meltdowns related to the ASD and issues with his dad. He was kicked out of two different schools. We started therapy and medication, for him and for me. But still, I transformed into this witch, a crazy person who can't take the meltdowns and normal little boy tantrums. I have no patience for him, it's al gone. I have mistreated him, slapped him a couple of times, spanked him a couple of times too. And I yell, a lot. This doesn't happen all the time, most of the time we are cuddling, playing, and having a good quality time. But when he starts with annoying things I just lose my temper and explode. I literally see red. 

Today we had a screaming match because he wanted to go see shazam (we already went, he wanted to leave the theater 10 minutes into the movie, so we did). I said ""no, we already went to see this movie and you decided to leave. We can watch another movie and wait for shazam to be available on dvd, netflix, whatever"". He then hit me, kicked me, cried for an hour combined with screaming ""I want to go se shazaaaam"". And I lost it, again. I didn't hit him (I'm working really hard to control the impulse to do that) but yelled very loudly, like I didn't care anymore. But I do care. Finally we both managed to calm down. I consoled him. He left for school shortly after.

I honestly don't know what to do. I grew in an abusive household, I don't want to be like my father, I don't want that life for my boy but I'm at the end of my rope. I live in a third world country so mental health is not covered through insurance or anything, also it would be impossible for me to go to therapy weekly as I once did because of my jobs (I work three jobs just to pay for his special school, therapies and medication among all the other normal expenses). I try to have some alone time every now and then and that helps. I have even thought of killing myself because I feel like a horrible human but I couldn't do that to him, his father already abandoned him, so that's not a real threat. My mom helps me a lot and is awesome but she's the only supportive person in my life and she's going through her own set of problems.

I know all I have written sound like excuses but they are not, is just my reality, I'm trapped in this awful nightmare of loving and abusing a little boy that deserves better. I want to do better. Any tips or advice? I'm want to start meditation, like short exercise that I could do daily at work, any good tutorials?
