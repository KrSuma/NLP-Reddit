15,1015," Toronto woman sues Rogers after her affair is exposed



"" 



A Toronto woman says the billing practices of Rogers Wireless Inc. led to her husband discovering her extramarital affair.



Now the woman, whose husband walked out, is suing the communications giant for $600,000 for alleged invasion of privacy and breach of contract, the results of which she says have ruined her life.



In 2007, Gabriella Nagy had a cellphone account with Rogers which sent the monthly bill to her home address in her maiden name. Her husband was the account holder for the family's cable TV service at the same address. Around June 4, 2007, he called Rogers to add internet and home phone.



The following month, Rogers mailed a ?global? invoice for all of its services to the matrimonial home that included an itemized bill for Nagy's cellular service, according to the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court of Justice.



When Nagy?s husband opened the Rogers invoice, he saw several hour-long phone calls to a single phone number.



?Nobody does business this way and he's not stupid,? says Nagy, who is in her 30s. He called the number, spoke to the ?third party? who confirmed the affair, which had lasted only a few weeks, Nagy told the *Star*.



?My husband didn't tell me that's how he found out, he just left.?



&#x200B;



"" 



Nagy is deeply embarrassed and ashamed about what happened. ?It was a mistake,? she said of the affair. ?But I didn?t deserve to lose my life over it.?



After her husband left her and their two children, ages 6 and 7, she was so distraught her work performance suffered and she lost her job as an apartment rental agent that had paid her almost $100,000 until she was let go in Oct. 10, 2007. ?The plaintiff wept uncontrollably at her workplace . . . and became incapable of performing her employment duties,? reads the statement of claim. Nagy says the employer was aware of the situation and that she was receiving medical attention.



Nagy?s lawyer, Edward Tonello, says this case is unprecedented in Canada.""

He has a very attractive face and is slim and tall. He was always popular with women and I think he never saw their negative side.



Unfortunately, he has a very weak personality. He always conforms to his current girlfriend. When he was dating a Christian girl, he was also a devout believer. His fiancee is now a radical feminist - so he's an atheist and also a radical feminist.



The woman is openly man-hating. She is spouting all the stereotypical crap about the wage gap, female oppression, welcoming of immigrants and so on. She literally told me to stop working out because I'm muscular enough already, even though I'm nothing special (no humblebrag intended). Guess I was a bad influence on her victim... She takes issue when we discuss female beauty but she was openly ogling a ripped black dude when we were in the baths a while ago (in the very presence of her fiancee). She is the embodiment of the cancerous 3rd wave feminist.



And now my best friend is going to swear before the law that they'll be together forever and link assets.

But as time has gone on, I've realised that all women are the same, and all women are abominable and irredeemable. 



I knew all of this subconsciously, but I still fought against it, because I was still under the blue pill romanticized mindset of love and commitment. But now my patience and tolerance for women has completely run out. My whole life, women have done nothing but make my life miserable. My mum was abusive, the girls at my school used to bully me, and I have never had a long term relationship with a female. And to be totally honest, I don't want to anymore. I just don't care anymore. I have no love for women whatsoever. I have decided to go full MGTOW monk for the rest of my life.

So, I've been GMOW without knowing I was GMOW.





Eventually I lost my war against social conditioning and found a girlfriend. To be honest, I was mostly curious about the sex and considering I was a 18 years old good looking guy, I think it just had to happen. We dated for 3 months, we had sex at the end of the 3rd month and I was like ""so, that's it?"". It clearly didn't worth my 3 months.

We were supposed to have a family dinner at my place. My mother apparently invited one of those women without letting me know in advance. The evening was really awkward with my mom trying to set us up. After the woman left, I couldn't take it anymore and just said everything I thought about women, dating, marriage and having children. I told them I don't need a woman in my life because I'm not really interested in with having a family and children. I can afford a cleaning lady, cook by myself or basically order. I told them, a woman at this point will be a liability to me. After hours of blaming and convincing attempts, they told me that they are ashamed of me and that they didn't raise me to be that selfish.

I get into these episodes where I just want to be comforted by a women. When I get home tired and stressed and I haven't eaten a lot and I am barely surviving I just want someone to hug me and tell me I am doing the best I can right now and that this is temporary. Unfortunately, this is unrealistic to want. Still, there's a subconscious want for it, and it aches my heart I will never know it. It's weird honestly. I want a girl to totally seduce me and make me go total simp mode but none of them seem worth really anything. I met one a few weeks ago who got me close to that but I later talked to her more and although her beauty is amazing you get used to it and she just becomes another girl. I know girls can't provide anything in my life. I struggle to think of one. They don't even provide sex since they are concious people so they can control and deny it. Unless you are in the top precent of guys, at least in my experience, she won't even attempt to care about you and will find your mental bullshit tiring, your problems annoying and pathetic, I remember my mom complaining about my dad's mental problems to me when I was younger, I heard this from my own mom, you think a young women would be any different?

I feel like my tax dollars go to things that don't benefit me and I am working to keep a society afloat that I don't want to be a part of anymore but I can't escape. There's no new lands or frontiers. I feel cornered and unable to escape any of this. My only escape would be that I can feel like I am in the top percentage of guys because the girl I hypothetically would be with cares about me. I can feel successful. But I know I'm not. I know I will have to give up so much for so little. Just like the girl I found attractive. She will seem amazing for the first couple weeks but then you get used to her and your ability to put up with her bullshit gets used up. Stress builds up. You don't want to be in this anymore.

MacKenzie Bezos will indeed walk away with a very substantial equity position in Amazon and no one knows how she'll vote as a shareholder. Bezos, having founded the company (and likely lost his relationship through that hard work) has been a reliable shareholder, with a specific vision. With a good part of his equity going to her, no one knows how she'll vote. Her taking a significant portion of the stock actually undermines the value of the stock itself, potentially, because she's a newbie investor with no real experience and now a huge share of control.



So really, when you think about it, any time you have a principal of a company who is married and has a significant share of stock, that's potential risk factor and not one discussed much by analysts.

So, as a preface, I have been getting used by women in plain sight for nearly all of my adolescent life and only just now realizing this. I'm a middle aged man, single/unmarried with no children, well-paying career, own a fun car and comfy house, and have been raised almost exclusively by women with very few legitimate male figures in my life. When there were any they weren't around for very long before being driven out by reasons I was too young to understand.

I never thought of women as manipulative, conniving or egotistical. I had always thought they were just the most beautiful creatures and naturally gravitated toward them just like the filthy beta male I am sad to admit I was. Still, I went largely unnoticed despite being Mr Nice. But now that I am very well off financially, mentally and physically, suddenly a few of the girls from my past have somehow managed to find and contact me. Of course, being the thirsty male that I was, I was ecstatic! ...So ecstatic that I was blinded by the truth. Their true motives for contacting me never crossed my mind... And all too soon, I found myself forking out large sums of money to them both after hearing their sob story about how life is not working out for them, and how they are divorced with a child or two. Two women who do not know each other reached out to me, and I began financially and emotionally supporting them both without thinking.

I am deeply disappointed in myself. The red pill is one of the roughest pills I have ever had to swallow because the more I research the more depressing and dark it becomes. I wish I could say it's funny how when I gave women attention I was ignored and when I ignored THEM and just focused on myself, they came back. But it's NOT funny. It's not funny at all to be the punchline of a joke you never knew you were part of. I am beginning to see the big picture and its the most ugliest painting imaginable. Full of the red flags and misleading patterns that can have you staring at the picture for ages, fully immersed and captivated as it slowly steals your soul and sanity. You begin to wonder what exactly is this picture trying to hide behind all of this complexity. You try to dismantle it line by line, only to end up with a dead end and no solution. A never ending labyrinth that once reaching the exit, you are placed back to the beginning. The only way out has been there all along. You press Pause, and you leave this stupid game. We have always had that option available to us, but its not easy to see the controller in your hands when you are so focused on a problem at face-level. Because men are thinkers and problem solvers. I have been oblivious for so long. The thing that triggered this was from a youtuber, Redpill Coach, who brought up the 3 basic things women want from a man.

To me, these seem like reasonable and simple things to aspire for in a life-long partner. I don't see anything wrong with any of those. Except how they are acquired from men by women, in the sneakiest way possible. As I continued into MGTOW videos and content, I am beginning to see something I could never see before. If you can prove to do at least 1 out of 3 of those, SOME type of woman will cling to you, no matter what, depending on her individual level of desperation. Obviously women who are in higher demand will be able to require all 3 and get just that and nothing less.

Unfortunate to say, I am prime example being roped into this concept. I was tying the noose to swing around my neck without me even knowing that I was. I have been providing #1 and #3 to these two women from my past who ignored me. #2 being only a plane flight away. Thankfully before that happened, one day, or rather, too many months too late, I decided to test them. I told them I was cutting my financial support to them due to some legit reason as best as I could pull off as convincing enough to them. Sure enough, they did not explode on me, but instead told me that it was ""OK"", and that ""at least I can continue to support them emotionally.""



TWO. SEPARATE WOMEN told me the EXACT same thing. This here was a HUGE eye opener for me. Because by me taking away #3, they were desperate enough to fall back on #1 just to keep me around as the bare minimum. It's not like it cost them anything to keep me around either, right? They still gained at no expense. I just proved myself right and it is the most disturbing and depressing thing I have ever experienced.

How did this happen to me? They are playing me for the fool and I am happily letting them with a smile on my face. I don't want to be a part of this system anymore.

All of that money I've donated to these struggling mothers could have easily been invested into something far more redeeming or useful, like food sent to children in Africa, or Children hospitals, or business investment, or even just paying off something in advance, or even keeping it in a savings account where it does nothing at all for any short period of time - even that would have been a better thing to do. Yet, instead I literally just assembled a mountain of cash in my backyard and set it all on fire. Where I stop providing, they will find someone who will, and not give me a second glance back, no matter how much I've helped them to this point. This has to be the very definition of being used.

After recently discovering MGTOW and the red pill, I am beginning to awaken and see the evil I never wanted to believe existed. I can't help but feel deeply disgusted with myself that I have allowed myself to be used to the most extreme form of being used; as a damn slave to people that I am socially well above. They are too clever. Or, rather, the will to survive is powerful that anything can be used as a tool, and then disposed of when done with. I'm too compassionate for my own good. It's difficult for me to say ""no"" to people who are stuck in a dire predicament but this is something I feel I am going to need to learn because I am noticing a trend that whenever I pull someone up out of a rut, I fall into one myself, and the people that I have helped are suddenly no where to be found. I need to stop forgetting that my life is about me and what I want to do with it, and things that jeopardize that basic principle should not be part of my life at all.

A super hero who receives no credit for his good deeds can easily either become a villain, or emotionally detached to the point that he will no longer bother trying to save and protect - and will let the world burn. Thus, Misogyny and MGTOW are born, respectively. Thankfully, I am not heartless enough to go the route of the former, because I believe self-reflection and self-correction is far useful to do rather than just pointing fingers at others for what they're doing. I am willing to point the finger at myself and work towards bettering myself, so I choose MGTOW and I will ever look back.

171,1171,"We can say a lot about the psychological and social differences between women but I think it comes down to a fear of failure in the end. It seems to be a pretty simple realization once you actually look at the way they behave instead of listening to the narrative pushed on you by society. Blindly believing the bullshit that you are told is what leads to men being so confused about what turns out to be very simple. You almost become an oracle once you accept the MGTOW/""red pill"" philosophy. You can see it on echo chambers like relationshipadvice, where time and time ago you see this story:



My girlfriend is acting more distant lately and hiding her phone. When we talk she seems disinterested and she went from texting me all the time to taking forever to respond.



Then you get the inevitable flood of comments that make logical sense, if women were men. ""Maybe she's stressed from work, have you considered talking to her?"" ""Maybe she just wants some alone time."" ""Maybe you've been coming across as needy/clingy, give her some space."" Then a week later there's an update that she's cheating. Big surprise. Or a guy is getting ghosted and goes ""I know she's been studying for midterms"" and everyone goes ""that's it, she's just busy"", as if people nowadays don't live on their phones. The idea that a person is so consumed with studying for two weeks that they don't have thirty seconds to text someone they're interested in, makes more sense to them than ""they're ghosting me.""



How does anyone actually believe any of this, honestly? I suppose it comes from an idealistic view of people, that we completely ignore what is plainly in front of us. They try to draw a tesseract as the quickest line between two points.



One of my favorite things is reading the Story Time threads on r/tinder, the same way I love cringe and outrage subreddits. The women stories are 75% them getting passively seduced by some Chad or talking about the ways the man failed to impress them; the guys talk about random ghosting and rejection with the occasional (temporary) success story. The other 25% of women stories are ""I really like this guy but I'm scared to ask him how he feels"" when it's obvious he likes her. They are just petrified by the idea of direct communication and possible rejection, even if the guy is driving three hours to see her, texts her he had a great time, kisses her at the end, buys her roses. It's absurd. Read any story told by a woman and look at how obviously their fear of failure/rejection permeates everything. They straight up say it half the time. I suppose there are also stories of women who are by any definition of the word sluts and just go around randomly sleeping with people, and chronicle it on that thread as if anyone cares they slept with multiple random guys over the weekend after five minutes of chatting. I can't shame them too much about it because I certainly enjoyed some delivery pussy but it is ridiculous. 



They go through life on training wheels even if they daydream that they're badass ninja warriors on motorcycles. Men learn failure and rejection because of things like being the ones expected to approach women. So we get laughed at, turned down, mocked, and it hurts like hell but eventually you scar over. People tell you ""keep trying, you just have to bear with it."" Eventually you toughen up, because everyone keeps telling you to do it. On the other hand, women simply don't do it, because they don't have to. The MGTOW philosophy says we don't have to either, but despite our reputation as ""incels"" most of us had to go through this blue-pilled woman-chasing process before ending up here. I certainly banged my head against the wall a few hundred times before I started to think ""was any of this really worth the sex?"" You start off wanting a relationship, end up accepting casual sex, then finally just give up.



The thing is it's not healthy at all for women. It's a large part of why they get an anxiety attack over a biology 101 exam, because they never have learned how to fail. Once you fuck up enough times you realize the consequences of anything are almost always bearable if not negligible. It's our fear of failure that fucks us up. Take pride in the fact that you have been forced to fail and suffer. There are women that I respect, often people like patients that have struggled with something like cancer and came out the other side alive. They learn to fight back.



Society shelters women so much that they never develop an immune system. Look at adversity as a vaccine. A fucking breeze can sweep a woman away, to the point they get triggered over reading fictional accounts of things. Read the story of some dude trying to lose his virginity, or a social outcast trying to interact with the outside world, and it closely mirrors the anxious language so common to women.



And that's the main difference between us, and why they have so many random little shit tests, roundabout ways of saying things, expect you to read their minds, or act passive-aggressive. It's all to deflect as much responsibility as possible from themselves, because if they aren't responsible for something then failure is something they never have to look in the eye.

Feminists have reinforced women's financial entitlements from men through divorce legislation.



Imagine a world where a woman was legally required to be financially responsible for herself and had no legal entitlement to force a man, married or not, to financially provide for her.  She could also not legally entitle herself to financial entitlements for herself by having children (like welfare payments).  Welfare would only be for the children if a woman had a baby.  This would force women to be responsible for themselves and would stop almost all new welfare cases in 9 months.



Even in this case, you notice that I didn't say she has to be responsible financially for the children.  I'm doing this to illustrate that even a bias against men financially could still help child poverty.  Because she has to be responsible for herself, instead of a man being forced to provide for her and children if married, he only has to provide for himself and children.



Framed another way, the money that would have been 'directed' from him to her, is instead directed to his children.  Poor men could then direct more resources to their children, and through successive generations progressively improve the lives of their children.



Even in this hypothetical situation, men would still be carrying a disproportionate load.  My point is that prioritizing women's financial entitlements from men hurts his children.",0,1556297394.0,bhojmk,19,MGTOW

Right now, I'm temporarily living with my mother and ""stepdad"" in his house, until the job I landed starts and I move out in a little over a month. They are only engaged, but this man already bought her a house to stay in. She is saving up her money from her job and helps out with some of the groceries and bills. I must also admit that she still pays for all of my bills as well; car insurance, phone bill, even my current gym plan.



 She told me, to my face, that she only moved in with him to save on bills, and for the fact that we (her kids) would have a comfortable place to stay in case we needed it. This dude is 100% all in, but she is so obviously not; and he knows it too. He tried to ask for a prenup (useless) but my mom then called her family, who then called this dude, which caused him to rescind the request entirely. To their face, while all 3 of us sat for dinner, I told them that property and contracts should have nothing to do with marriage. I am not EVER signing a contract. You are already living with me in my house, which I bought for your comfort and continue to take care of you. Why, for the love of Christ, do I need to sign a contract? Why am I sharing this? Look guys I love my mother. No amount of red pills is going to change that. Right after me, she's next on the scale of humans alive that I care about... But she IS human. NEVER loose sight of this! Women are all the same. I took her right off that goddamn pedestal, and behold! Every other broad is just another broad. AWALT always. Do not forget this.

They cannot choose a man that they want, a man that would be good for them. They are unable to say no to scum that will destroy them further than they already are. They exhibit predictably unpredictable behavior. They cannot love anything besides themselves(I'm not sure if they actually love their kids or see them as a part of themselves) and they will never get any genuine love because of that. With feminism, women are self destructing even more. They cannot understand that, they never will, they just follow what the herd does. They will never pair bond with a man(some can only with their first but they won't stay). Our culture encourages them to self destruct even more. Women need a good man or they will go extinct. But our culture doesn't let a man keep them on a leash. When women grow old they will eventually feel the lack of love and being narcissistic they will fall into depression. They cannot realise that. No amount of rational talking with them can help. They are deeply sick and we cannot help them even if we wanted to. For me they're like robots who have gone insane. They are empty shells that absorb their current man's values only for them to change when they new branch comes in. They are nothing without a man.

In college, met a girl, she had actually started seeing one of my good friends at the time but he was being an asshole towards her so she kinda drifted to me (I was a nice guy, raised in the south, grew up blue pilled, treat women like queens, etc.) and we really hit it off. Eventually ended up living together (I know, but it was actually a much cheaper alternative than my other options, plus I was young and stupid so). Made a great couple, active sex life, had fun doing just about anything together, etc. We graduated and I got a job back in her home town coincidentally, so that's where I was headed and she decided to come with me.



Things started to slowly decline. She blamed it on all the negativity in her hometown (her parents weren't very good and apparently she had a bad past) but I figured it was nothing, I could help her through it. Love conquers all right? (HAHAHAHAHA, no).



After six months or so of us both having jobs, I proposed to her and we got married (diamond rings all that shit), I'll spare you the details. Well guess who didn't get laid on his wedding night? Yep. This guy. Or hardly at all on the honeymoon. Whatever, I wrote it off as stress from the wedding so I assumed it would pass.



Fast forward, bought a house, had it for about 3 years. During this time we have struggled even more to have sex and she always had an excuse. ""I just have too much on my mind"" ""I just can't relax"" etc etc the list goes on. Every now and then we'd have it when she was magically in the mood. During this time I wanted her to talk to a doctor or seek a professional about it because it was driving a wedge between us. She never did.

This is something she has NEVER said like EVER. She always wanted to be around me and doing things with me all the time if at all possible. The concept of her needing space away from me all of a sudden just didn't add up.



Well she starts isolating herself to our guest room every night stating she was just decompressing or whatever. I'm like okay I'll play video games or something. (Which I rarely got to do since she was so controlling with my time, so I was sorta happy about it.)



Well after about 4 counseling appointments she comes to me and says she wants to leave, that she doesn't think it's helping. She said anything from ""I'm just bored"" to  ""you don't support me and my career"" (which I have no idea where that came from since I always supported her moving up at work and was proud of her for her accomplishments). These were obviously bullshit reasons. I was so hurt, bawling, crying. I made a commitment and I wanted to stick to it and make it work, truly for better or worse but she didn't care anymore. I honestly don't think me being so upset phased her at all, just so cold and cruel.



Well she gets a lawyer, moves out, has to move in with her parents because she doesn't make enough to live on her own. Later on we talk about starting over and trying again to fix things. She states that she realizes now what she had and wishes she had just appreciated it more and put more effort into it. Being the analytical person that I am, I didn't take this at face value so I drilled into her with ""Why's"" until I got the truth.



Well guess what gentlemen, she had done gone and fucked someone else. Which, I normally wouldn't care because whatever you're gone now, do as you please, except she did this BEFORE coming to me saying she screwed up, not to mention all the sexual rejection she gave me as her husband, her provider, the person who cared about her the most and treated her like a queen. So yeah it really is that quick and easy for them. They can be on a different cock as soon as they leave you, if not before they leave.



Found out from a mutual friend that she had been talking to this guy pretty much all along since things started to unravel. I don't know where he came from or who he is but my hunch is that the ""space"" she needed was just her talking to this guy about our marriage and I've no doubt he was agreeing with her and going along with it just to get her into bed. So between stupid emotional wife and this asshole of a Chad, she got her mind made up that she just wanted a divorce and nothing I could have said or done would have mattered.



Now she is regretting her decision big time and feels like a fucking idiot but there's no way I could go back now, I'd be disrespecting myself. Besides, I'm happy and healthier now, and she's more unhappy than she was when we were married (guess that really says it all). 



Anyway guys, AWALT and don't ever forget it. Don't ever think you found a unicorn because you probably didn't. Don't ever get married as there's no benefit. I was actually fortunate in my case, didn't lose much (kept my house and my cat) and no kids. Ironically it all started with me white knighting and saving her from some asshole and ended with her leaving me for some asshole (that I'm pretty certain just pumped and dumped her, and BTW he ought to be beaten for being a homewrecker, that's not how you treat a fellow man).

Men pay 70% of all taxes in USA, and 74-80% in UK, depending what study you read.  But men don't get half the tax benefits, it [goes disproportionately to women](https://www.avoiceformen.com/featured/research-finds-that-as-a-group-only-men-pay-tax/).  Women feel entitled to be financially provided for by men, (even after children are old enough to not need direct supervision).  Feminists have reinforced women's financial entitlements from men through divorce legislation.



Imagine a world where a woman was legally required to be financially responsible for herself and had no legal entitlement to force a man, married or no, to financially provide for her.  She could also not legally entitle herself to financial entitlements for herself by having children (like welfare payments).  Welfare would only be for the children if a woman had a baby.  This would force women to be responsible for themselves and would stop almost all new welfare cases in 9 months.



Even in this case, you notice that I didn't say she has to be responsible financially for the children.  I'm doing this to illustrate that even a bias against men financially could still help child poverty.  Because she has to be responsible for herself, instead of a man being forced to provide for her and children if married, he only has to provide for himself and children.



Framed another way, the money that would have been 'directed' from him to her, is instead directed to his children.  Poor men could then direct more resources to their children, and through successive generations progressively improve the lives of their children.

I have been rethinking my life lately, in the past 8 months perhaps, I was a stupid leftist got sucked into the feminist cult, and all the garbage that they promoted and the groupthink, it was basically the breaking point why I left that crap. In fact to be honest I never even really believed in the feminist crap I just went along with it mostly, although I wanted just equality, simple respectable equality between men and women, I realized how agressively they pushed the feminist narrative and censored me whenever I pointed out how men are opressed in modern society and how easy women have it with all the technological, legal and economic privileges that they got, not to mention the eternal power of the vagina. I start to realize that this itself is still weak, so I have been reading up on MGTOW the past 2 weeks and I already knew about it in the past, though I used to dismiss it, but now I am getting blackpilled or how do you say it, I am really starting to figure out just how problematic women are. I have been doing a lot of introspection, rethinking my whole life, and the women that I met in my life and I start to think that it's disastruous.



My last GF broke up with me in the middle of being in a low point. I was depressed the past few years and had some personal problems, I met this girl before that and we were together about 3 years. Initially she supported me and cared for me, but then she slowly faded away, the relationship went cold and she became disinterested. She couldn't or wouldn't want to bear my burden, and then 1 day she just broke up with me and left without a say. Then later she apologized and wanted us to remain friends, which I agreed to. To my knowledge she didn't had other guys she was kind of lonely too, but

just the mere fact that she would have to stick around and support me emotionally was too much for her and she couldn't take it. Fucking spoiled cunt. She hit me when I was on the ground, it felt very bad, I was even more depressed after that, but now I am recovering and have mostly recovered. I have rethinked my ideology and my entire life meaning and I have came to the conclusion that being individualist is the best way to live your life, because it gives you all the freedom to enjoy the pleasures that you have without any of the burdens that come with it. So naturally MGTOW is the next step I believe.



Women are just so different, I don't know WTF is this. I realized that I don't even enjoy their presence anymore, and have already started adopting some isolationist tactics that I read, I keep contact and chit-chat to a bare minimum now. You can't even talk to them, it's like they are a different species.



Like this modern SJW liberal culture is as bad as it gets so you can't have meaningful conversations anymore with people. With males it's like about 40-50% of them are low tier sheeps, with whom you can only talk basic stuff like your personal life, ironically women issues, sports, the weather, and basic stuff like this. About 30% of them are above average with whom you can have a normal male-to-male conversation about higher topics like politics, ethics, ideology, culture, science. And about 20% of them are geniuses with whom you can have a very high level conversation about high philosophy and expert topics in whatever field you are interested.



With women it's like you are talking to a sack of rocks. About 95% of women, and I am not exagerating, are as dumb as a sack of rocks. You can never really go beyond talking about trivial stuff: relationship issues, family, sex, work, and basic hobby, and perhaps politics (but only surface level namecalling, but not deep theory, ever). Even if you try to bring up more complex issues, they become instantly turned off, and start doing something else, play with their phones, or just do do something else. You can never, ever ever have a meaningful conversation with 95% of women, they are as dumb and indifferent as a sack of rocks. Then about 4.99% of women are above average with whom you can go to talk about beyond surface trivia but even here you have to be careful to avoid **keywords** that might trigger her pre-programmed feminist ideology, and become hysterical and defensive, spoiling the chances of having a calm rational debate and end up screaming and insulting eachother in the end. And only about 0.01% of women are respectable, whom I can admire, who actually have done something with their lives and can behave rationally. Ironically these women eventually inhibit male traits. Like my doctor is a woman, and I respect her, she is very professional and talented, but she has short hair, deep male voice, and has military style discipline which makes her more manly than womanly. Rest assured the women in the top 0.01% are not the dumb blonde bimbos you meet at the mall.



So overall just being a woman is very weird and problematic. Like how the fuck is this even possible? Is the pussy power so strong that males have been manipulated by women for centuries to sustain them, whereas they themselves are essentially useless otherwise. Like I really start to think that the only thing good about a woman is her pussy and her tits, and they are just masturbatory toys for men to have pleasure and make babies. Everything else about them is worthless. There is nothing that they can do, and feminists are trying real hard to hide this fact. How are even women able to survive without men looking out for them, or the govt giving them welfare? They are so stupid and irrational that just by natural chances they would naturally go away, if they would not be necessary to make babies.



And I am really tired of engaging women, it's just so predictable what will happen, it's almost cringy. Whenever I go to a date, it's like it either ends up in the bedroom or with some lousy excuse that she is ""not ready yet"" or whatever. It's soooo predictable every single time, like what is the point of dates even, why not just flip a fucking coin, and if it lands on the head, we fuck and if on tails then we part our ways. What is the need fo this dumb ritual of asking girls out, spending a lot of money on them just to get access to her meat purse. It's very dumb if you think about it. It's just paying for her comfort. And the talk that she gives on dates is just so boring, like I should just leave and let her talk to herself because I don't care about her little brother painting the fridge accidentally or her little cousin being too goofy at his birthday. Why do I even have to listen to this crap just to have access to her pussy? I am interested in tech, I work in IT, I want to talk about the internet and coding, but then I would come out as a lousy nerd. Like how cringy it would be if I would start talking about Javascript bugs and PHP tricks at a date instead of her dumb cousin, she would get embarassed and would leave, because she is too dumb and too comfortable to even have to use her brains to make money by this. All my female colleagues are essentially just props, they only do basic shit, and a white knight colleague always helps them make up for their deficiency. Women are really useless in every field which requires an IQ above 90. I repeat there are no women in IT because they are dumb, and the women that somehow do get there can only do basic shit (that I used to do when I was 11 years old) and a white kinght will always cover for them, they don't deserve their paycheck. 



I have never met a single intelligent woman in my entire personal life (except in professional relations). Not a single girlfriend, not a single friend that I hanged out with, not a single neighbors or work colleague, not a single schoolmate, not even my own mother.



Even my own mother, who I love and care for her, but even she is very irrational and hysterical, and I can't talk with her about complex things. I have never had a single deep conversation in my entire life with her, it was always a shallow superficial conversation. I don't know about you guys, or I don't know what a normal family would look like, but from seeing it in movies (which should not be regarded as a standard), I thought that mothers always sit down with their kids and have a deep talk with them about their future, or ethics and morality. I haver had that with my mom. We are talking, and it's not that she is abusive or anything, we have a normal relationship, we are not angry at eachother or anything, but it's just that our relationship is very shallow. I have never been able to have a deep conversation with her about anything. Even when I asked her about dating advice, and told her the problems I had with girlfriends, she just shrugged it off and said ""well girls are like that just get used to it"" or ""this girl is bad but you will find a better one"". 



No I didn't, every single girl that I dated was a dumb shallow cunt, and I didn't even go after the hoe sluts, I instinctually knew to stay far from them, my type is the ""little cute princess type with a nice ass"", so I mostly dated girls with 1-2 partners and even virgins when I was young (though I didn't take their virginity, they stabbed me in the back just before we were about to fuck). I was a good gentleman, always bought flowers, was a nice guy, but they mostly treated my like trash and always expected things from me. They never really surprized me with anything or never initiated anything. Like even sex was like a begging, I had to beg them to have sex, and they were like ""oh reall you want to fuck again, not now sweetie I am tired maybe tomorrow"". I was like a child that needs to beg them to do something because they would have never initiated anything. Like the money and time I wasted on these cunts, I would have expected at least 1 of them to say ""hey baby do you want us to go upstairs and have some fun"", it never happened, I always had to beg them to get anything. You know not ""beg"" like to humiliate myself, but ""beg"" in the sense that I had to be the initiator always and I had to push them going out of my way to even have access to their cunts. It felt so unnatural, I always thought (from stupid movies of course) that women are really loving and caring and playful, but every single dumb cunt I have been with was a passive shallow soulless prop that wouldn't even have moved her fingers if I wouldn't have said something. Maybe I was just extremely unlucky in my dating life but I think he evidence is clear that it isn't just me.



Now every time I go out somewhere and some fat hoe starts looking at me, and tries to flirt, it's just so irritating. Like these are the only women that would have initiate something but I am not into fat women. But the women that I like, are always passive. I mean God is it really too much to ask for to just take the initiative, why do they behave like all they have between their 2 ears is mush. These dumb cunts who sit on FB all day and text eachother with their phones, and really have no life essence in them just to ""feel good"" date as many guys as possible and make sure their comfort and income is sustained by some loser white knights.



I am really getting tired of women and it gets harder and harder to even want to enter into a relationship with anyone. Like since I am free, I just feel so good and so liberated. I can sleep better, I can do my hobbies, and can organize my time schedule the way I want (since my work schedule is flexible). I can shave myself the way I want. I can wear the clothes I want and just spend time reading more and learning.



When I was in a relationship, yes it partially felt good for the emotional attachment, and the pussy was good, better than my left hand and a blanket. But everything else was bad. I constantly felt under stress ""what if I said something that hurt her"" , ""what if she wants to break up"" , ""how to get her to do this and that"". It was such an extra burden that I don't need anymore. The breaking up is hard because of the emotions, but everything that comes after is much more liberating and lively. Like always having to go to those boring dates when she talks about dumb cousings and trivial crap like that, it feels like a stupid ritual just to get the pussy, and I really hate repetitive things. Like you have to do X, Y and Z which you hate, but you do it for the pussy no? Fuck that, I'd rather get some prostitutes or whatever, it's not worth being in relationship at all. She doesn't care about you, she never pays attention to you, and she will drop you anyway after she finds a chad, why should you do it? And why risk it, since we all know about this crap with rape accusations and alimony payments for long term relationships. It feels like the pussy is just a curse for males.

Search for antonyms of any masculine trait to discover the equivalent feminine trait.   



The MGTOW movement is a natural response to the current imbalance between the two poles of masculine and feminine.   Men are walking away in droves because feminism removed the societal constraints that kept female nature in-check.  



Those constraints were put in place by men who rebuilt previous societies that females destroyed.  These constraints were never about ""oppression"", they were about protection.



JD Unwin's book [Sex and Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_Culture) documents the rise and fall of every great civilization over the past 5,000 years.  What he discovered is astounding, every single one of them followed the same pattern that we are experiencing today. 



> These societies lived in different geographical environments; they belonged to different racial stocks; but the history of their marriage customs is the same. In the beginning each society had the same ideas in regard to sexual regulations. Then the same struggles took place; the same sentiments were expressed; the same changes were made; the same results ensued. Each society reduced its sexual opportunity to a minimum and displaying great social energy, flourished greatly. Then it extended its sexual opportunity; its energy decreased, and faded away. The one outstanding feature of the whole story is its unrelieved monotony.



[This blog post](https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/30/jd-unwin-detailed-how-feminism-would-destroy-culture-30-years-before-womens-lib/) summarizes the Sex and Culture book.  Definitely worth reading.



In all of these societies, the loosening of restrictions of females lead to feminism which lead to the decline and collapse of the society.  Unwin also stated that you can never undo it, once the genie is out of the bottle it can never be put back.



Here's [another article](http://diversitymachtfrei.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-problem-with-feminism-why.html) that references Unwin's work when discussing the role of feminism and the collapse of the west.   



JD Unwin discovered that these societies collapsed within 10 generations, or about 250 years.  The United States was founded in 1776, but the Boston Tea Party happened in 1773 and this was arguably the spark that gave birth to our nation.

* Been together for 5 years

* She doesn't do anything useful, I do all the cleaning, cooking, etc, basically I'm the chef/maid/butler

* Last year she decided to get a puppy even though she knew I didn't want a dog yet, she barely takes care of it so its full of energy, unless I take it for a long walk/play, ironically these walks are probably what gave me enough time to look inward and find MGTOW

I'm scared to kick her out since I could see her going ballistic and trying to kill me or ruin my life. (Main reason being she hasn't done anything wrong by societies standards. Like she hasn't been caught cheating or anything a blue pill relationship can be ended over.) She's gone ballistic before towards other people and they were barely doing anything to get mad over, for example playing Catan and someone played a Monopoly card. I thought it was hilarious at the time but I should have taken it as a red flag.

And so far it worked great! Im generally incredibly fit and my business has really started to pick up some steam but after two years the whole ?no girls? thing is starting to wear on me.



It?s especially bad since girls started to give me more and more attention everywhere I go ( not to brag but im a pretty good looking guy). It?s getting even worse now in the spring since there are hot girls literally EVERYWHERE! 



I also don?t hang out with friends that often anymore since im so super busy but when I do all they talk about is girls and most of them have girlfriends. 



Now I know girls are a bad idea in general but in my situation they would be really bad since I barely have any free time as it is. All I do is work, go to the gym and box and I do it 6-7 days a week. I would literally have no time for a girlfriend even if I wanted to.

&#x200B;



For those who still like sex, ESCORTS mean:



&#x200B;



FREEDOM - you are able to enjoy pleasure without giving up control of your life.



HAPPINESS - going full monk mode takes a dent in your spirit. Strong men carry on but there are other ways.



PEACE OF MIND - you no longer have to worry about pleasing women to get them to cooperate with you.



FUN - I mean, how much fun can be a regular dose of good sex.



NOVELTY - a different woman everytime is as good as it gets.



SAFE - most of these women practice safer sex than the ones you meet online. Plus, no pregnancies, no lawsuits, no clinging, no daddy issues, no nothing.



TRUE - these women are true in their intentions, they take your money and have sex with you. Everybody is happy.



MEMORIES - later on you will always have good memories of these encounters, that will put a smile in your face everytime.



FREE TIME - you get to have sex AND get to keep your free time for yourself, unlike in a relationship.



DEPENDABLE - you can always have sex with them whenever YOU feel like. No headaches and other bullshit.



COST EFFECTIVE - seriously, just pop up a spreadsheet and check out how much your previous relationships have costed.



NO CONTRACT - whenever you feel like taking a break and save some money, no one will come after you.



&#x200B;



and...



&#x200B;



OUTCASTS - most men are outcasts in modern society, women treat us like shit. They control the sex supply and use it to keep men on a leash. Well, escorts are breaching this barricade and coming through to our side. Like us, they are hated by most women. We should welcome them and treat them well because they are here to help us. They simply get paid for their time, like most of us in our jobs, no big deal about that. Escorts take power away from feminists and give it to men.

I?ve dated and every single relationship has ended because I wasn?t feeling something for her and decided it was best for both of us in each instance. Not every single time but most, they developed feelings for me but for whatever reason I did not.

&#x200B;



I work in a shitty job (cant give more info about my job).



4 years i do it after 1.5 years of unemployment because of feminist/leftist have me been fired.



Part time job with irregular hours, but it paid somewhat well, 21/h and i dont do much, nothing physical and not much customers.



Its a no stress job, but its not a job made to live, nor something i can be proud of. It paid the bills and i can put in the side but it all.



&#x200B;



I'm likely to have a mental breakdown because i dont have anything to do in my work, and even bringing stuff to do (books, games or even IT projects or whatever i totally dont have the right to bring) wont prevent me of being bored.



I'm bored to death in this job. To be honest, that been 2 years i play games or do my own business, and nobody ever talked about it to my boss... (because i do my work first i suppose).



I just put my ass and wait.



That not really true because i do the job my coworker dont do. But even with that, i'm bored to death.



&#x200B;



I have one chief on site half the week, and another who is in charge of all other places.



Say one is my supervisor and the other is the manager, and also a tyrannic boss who yell nearly everytime unless its a ""good day"". Its also a family member of my supervisor.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



Year ago i looked up to evolve from where i'm in my professionnal life, because it has been some time, the ride was fun, but i need to go one day or another.



Have worked on construction from 17y old, as well as desk jobs.



I'm an hard worker and thought of taking adventage of my part time work to study and find a new job at the end, leaving this shithole of a job.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



So i thought about studing to become an IT worker (because i always were happy with computers and have some experience in it and always tought that i couldnt work in that field and that i maybe should launch myself in this field for good).



I found a 2 years study, mainly in infrastructure field, with a certificate made for work (so in the end a business is likely to take me).



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



So, i planned to ask my big boss (the big manager) to have the 2-3 days evenings per week free to go to class (before signing contract with the school).



Plain and simple, just asking i dont work 2-3 days evenings per week because of class, and could work any other day like normal.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



Before sending to the big boss, i asked before to my supervisor, the guy who hired me, to see if he would give me a helping hand (after all i've done for him and for the work) so the letter get like a cutter in butter.



So the thing i wanted is to add to the letter is a sentence like ""Mr. X the supervisor has nothing against the fact i have a planing agreement"". Stating he support my choice and support me in the end.



In my mind, it was so the big boss say ""Hell, if he dosent mind, go for it, i dont care.""



Because my supervisor make the planning and send it to the manager who approve (everytime) it.



So in the end the only one who have shit to do about it is my supervisor.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



Four years that i serve at my best, 1-2 times came to work late or miss opening hour in four years... done everything, came in my free time out of emergency, done every crap things in there, train every new guys, well, they can count on me for everything. Never asked anything and even took 2x less holidays than any others coworkers.



And you know what ? MY supervisor say to me this afternoon after reading my email : ""well, you know how he will mostly take this. And there is also the other coworker who already have an agreement. Oh you know he will see you as a guy studying during work and leaving after... so good luck."" (In short).



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



So in his mind, i'm a guy who come to work to get his check, dont do shit, and should get a white hand from him because i'm like any other coworker who mostly work here 1 year and get out after his study is done.



You know i give this guy christmas and birthday gift because i though i oww him having this job and somwhat ""appreciate"" him ?...



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



That was i though will happen, sadly. But that drove me mad in a way. 



&#x200B;



I do shit everyday for 4 years, and they always complain ""we dont do shit"" while in the same time they remove us tools and work to do...



My new coworker have an agreemnt from day one for study, and the guy who hire me and know me cant support my demand after four years of loyal services.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



So finally, going to the core of the problem :



&#x200B;



I have sended the letter whitout the specified phrase to the manager.



Simply stating i want to attend study, class happen 2-3 time per week and would like to be free to get to class. 



That i worked for 4 years and will stay and work any other time needed for work, just that i need those days free and i be grateful he accept this.



&#x200B;



Monday the letter should get into my big yelling boss, so i wait until he give me an answer until deciding of next move.



&#x200B;



But, my problem is simple :



&#x200B;



If i recieve a ""Ok"" i have no problem at all, as you would have understand, my goal is to continue working, studying and change job in 2 years (300% profit, 100 profit working, 100% profit studying, 100% profit putting money on the side) so there will be no problem at all.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



BUT, if i recieve a ""no"" wich is a 50/50 chance, i can :



&#x200B;



\- Either stay, and get more money and wait it close (because i will within 2 years nearly sure because of lack of customers and district transformation), and start class when i'm 32y, stacking money in between.



&#x200B;



\- Either i put a resign, 2 month before class start, fight with employment welfare because i resign myself and they will punish me and find ways to sort things wich will be difficult.



&#x200B;



\- Either i make everything possible to get fired (with the help of my boss (good) or truly making it impossible for them to not fire me (bad) so i can get employment welfare and start class with some piece of mind.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



Dont take me wrong, i dont want to get on welfare. I hate this, truly. Have got 1.5 years on welfare, i cant stand social worker, nor welfare.



I prefer this job than being unemployed as it was really a chance for me after a year of unemployment to have this job... But....



But in the same time, its like a golden jail -> Leave, you lose everything. Stay, you're dying in little fire.



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



&#x200B;



**So, the big question : what would you do in this kind of situation ?**



&#x200B;



Would you rather resign and deal with all the crap of welfare saying you shouldnt had made this ? Loosing all 10k emergency money in the process ?



Or stay, even dying inside with a crappy job that will inevitably close and will fire/wathever you because it cant coninue like this for 10 years ?



&#x200B;



My MGTOW mindset tell me to take my balls, resign 2 month before class start, use my emergency money to pay class and find whatever job, but in the same time, its that golden jail dilemma : staying, no stress, take money, and stop caring.



&#x200B;



So, thank for your help...

I haven't been on this sub for a while but I do Understand and like the message that MGTOW tells guys. Do what you need to do, don't let women be in control of your life, etc. I do have a few Questions. I Just turned 26 not too long ago. The job I have has me moving around a lot and doesn't really give me time to have a traditional dating in my life. What I mean by that is I have to use online dating as much as I don't like it. I feel like online dating is a joke. For one we have a lot of ""I will do anything for Pussy boys"" Out there so a lot of the women think they are too good. Two most of the time the women that you do get matched with are bots, fat chicks, or are real but just want you to pay for a meal. I even had one girl try to tell me it's normal for men to buy her things and she does nothing in return but let them be in the same space as her. So just to make this short I'll ask my question. I'm trying to get to the end game which is for me having a family with kids. Really want a son and 2 daughters  (I want the son first for the reason anyone could understand). My question is how does one get to that point. When dating now is trash. if you look at a woman the wrong way its rape. I'm just trying to understand. I love the message that MGTOW puts out but I need an end game. I don't want to be old in a big house by myself for no one to pass my hard work down to. So What do you think would be the best move.

I was with a girl for a couple of years, travelled with her, thought she was a ""queen"", bought her nice things...I hadn't found MGTOW or RedPill or anything like that yet.  I come from a family where I had an extremely strong father, and mother and I figured I would be able to be the ""provider"" that I had been told I was to be.  



I started dating her, things were great but there were so many red flags that I decided to push to the side (big mistake) she had major daddy issues, still lived at home (in her late 20's) didn't really have many career aspirations aside from moving to a different country....without a plan as what to do once she got there.



I have a pretty successful career, and I was able to purchase properties where I made the mistake of moving her into my place without really having a discussion.  This was about 18 months into the relationship.  Once she moved in, her work went to shit, and the sex completely stopped.  She wouldn't chip in with anything requiring spending any money, and this is totally my fault for not nipping it in the bud right away.   



Fast forward about 6 months, I was engaged like an idiot.  It was from thinking that it was the right thing to do, and I truly believed it.  Little did I know that it was going to turn to hell.



I had a friend that she never was jealous about, until one day, she lost her goddamn mind on me for having this friend.  I was to cut this person out of my life, or else.  



Well, I wouldn't do that, because it was the one thing that I still had.  She had told her friends about this friend and they convinced her that because I wouldn't do this, that I didn't love her and that she should move out.  



One day, I came home from work to find her packing up all her shit in suitcases and saying that she was done.  



Me, being the simp I was at the time, was basically on my knees begging for her not to leave.



She moved out, my world was shattered, and I totally spiralled out of control.  Thank heavens I have great friends and family that were able to help me out. 



I had to go to therapy to get over it, and I wasn't able to get over her for over a year.



The only thing that helped, was that I had a redpilled as hell therapist that specialized in men's issues, and he was the first person that really told me to cut her out of my life completely.  



I didn't listen for about a year, but once I did, I realized how stupid I was that I ever committed to a woman like that.  



I'm 33 years old, and I'm completely free from women.  I want nothing to do with them.  Not friendship, I've spun plates, but that got really boring really quickly.

Don't get into long term relationships folks.  It's really not worth it.  They always come with ultimatums and they're never going to go your way.  Continue on growing as men, and don't hate women for what they are.  Just avoid them when possible.

I hired a lawyer for the lawsuit and represented myself for the restraining order hearing. I was able to show she was making false allegations during the RO hearing and the judge ruled in my favor. The RO was terminated and my rights have been fully restored. 



As for the lawsuit, I settled for a small penitence which didn't even cover her legal fees. I could have fought her for more but after almost a year, I'm willing to let go of a little cash in order to move on with my life. 



As for where I'm at today, you wouldn't recognize the man I've become after rebuilding from this experience. I've focused on my family, my friends, and most importantly myself. I've learned to never place my power in the hands of woman ever again. I will never remarry, I will never cohabitat, and I will never commingle finances with a woman ever again. I've played the field for years, I've had my fair share of women, and it's time I go my own way. Women may come and go in my life, but they will never again hold sway over me.



So, cheers and hearty thank you to the men here who helped me overcome this nightmare. As the saying goes, ""just as iron sharpens iron, men sharpen men.""

Edit: Just to be clear, I recognize that my results ARE NOT typical and I'm fully aware that most men are destroyed by these types of false accusations.

It did not come easy and the cost was more than just money; countless sleepless nights, panic attacks, and ptsd are just a few of the ""gifts"" I received from my ex. But like I said, I'm now a stronger, better man thanks to her and the men here who continue to help build other men.

The platoon was from the 101st Airborne,  which is the same one from the book / TV series ""Band of Brothers"", which hopefully most of you have seen.  Watching the movie and thinking on the differences between the two; main character in Overlord was a black guy with a good heart and conscience, naturally there was a pretty, waif-like girl who also kicked arse and took names, the Nazis were movie stereotype Nazis (cruel, mad, psychotic, etc) and the rest of the guys in the platoon were pretty one-dimensional stereotypes (""tough guy"", ""wise-cracking cynic"", etc).



Compared this to Band of Brothers (2001) which had no kick-arse femme fatales, I'm not even sure I can recall a single black or Asian guy in it and most of the Germans were portrayed as normal soldiers as well.  It was a TV series focused on being faithful to Stephen E Ambrose's book and historically accurate / realistic with no other agendas at play.  A series completely focused on making a quality production and nothing else.  It struck me that if that series was (re)made now, how badly would today's demand for equal representation, inclusion and shoe-horning social narratives into big budget productions fuck it up?  Would Easy Company suddenly have POCs and tiny girls beating up men twice their size to show women's strongkth?

It comes down to control. A woman will despise you if they can control you. The bad boy controls the relationship and the girls hate this. This is why they keep hanging on to the bad boy. Because they want to break him down. That's why women absolutely hate rejection, because the man controlled the narrative and told them to get lost. So the bad boy represents a challenge for them, it keeps their interest levels high thinking about how they are going to take control. Because most of the men are the nice guys and the girls have control and don't have to plot and scheme and hence, their interest levels don't get exercised.



And it's interesting with the real bad guys, the guys that really treat the girls like shit. The girls desire for control is so powerful that they hate themselves for continuing on with this guy but they can't help it. They want to break the guy down even if it means continuing the relationship with a piece of shit. In a way, it's pathetic.

My father used to be a Major in the Air force so about every 4 years we would move. I had somewhat adapted to it by just blocking it in. After my dad retired when I was 13 we moved to Woodstock, GA as a transition year in order to figure out where we wanted to live.  Though in this singular year I met a lot of good friends and a girl.



&#x200B;



Her name was Gwendolyn and she was something. I won't say it was love at first sight because what we had wasn't love.  It was the first time that a certain flame was lit inside me. We began talking pretty quickly and became close. About 3 weeks in she told me she had broken up with her boyfriend because of me (Red flag 1). We knew we had liked each other and she wanted to take it slow which I respected but I didn't understand. She strangely asked me not tell anybody of how we felt, though I would tell my friend would backstab me and tell her. She wouldn't talk to me for a few weeks (Red Flag 2). I remember that day that I was so frustrated with myself and that I cried in the shower for a bit though it would only be that day. I relationship would again stabilize and after a few weeks my cousin had convinced me to ask her out again. This would be about half way through my year and I wanted to enjoy it as much as possible so I did again. Even though we clearly had feelings she didn't want to and by this point she knew I was moving (Red Flag 3). I remember being disappointed but not crushed. We would still be close talking almost everyday and all day. On my last 2 days there she asked me to go to her church with her (For people not in christian dating this is like first base where you meet her friends and she chooses based on their opinions of you, stupid I know). I enjoyed it a lot and spending time with her. We acted like a couple basically the entire time. If you asked me who was the one back then, I would've confidently said her. Though it came much to late. 



&#x200B;



After I moved she wanted to go further. She asked me if we could be unofficially official (Red flag 4). We still kept talking pretty consistently for awhile though it wouldn't last long. About 2 months into long distance she broke it off claiming that every time she felt sad it traced back to her having a boyfriend. I remember just screaming WHAT a million times and to this day still have no idea what it meant. Most of freshmen year I blocked out the pain and focused on playing video games competitively (specifically team fortress 2 if you're interested). Though it slowly creeped in and took over by sophomore year and I was crushed to my very core. I had convinced myself that it was my fault and I didn't fight hard enough for her. I thought about her like a past time and constantly reminded myself of her. About every 1 or 2 months I would have to pour myself out to her to not completely collapse on myself. Most of the time I would have no response and if I did it was a short dialogue about how she did care. Though looking back on it she never cared and if she did she never showed it to me. Things I was confident in my whole life like video games, politics and choir became extremely hard and I could not confidently enjoy them. I was sent to a dark place of self-hatred for myself and I had to rebuild myself in a prison of shame and failure. I eventually blocked out my feelings towards her and began to respect and trust myself again. Late last year we began talking a little again and I let myself feel what I felt when I was 13. I knew it was dangerous for me though she accepted all the compliments that were obviously very obvious even though she had a boyfriend (Red Flag 5). I just recently about 2 months ago finally blocked her out of my life on everything, couldn't see her on social media, blocked and unfriended on all forms of communication so she couldn't talk to me. A good group of gentlemen have fully ushered me out of that era of my life and I am greatly in debt to them.

One story that stuck out was about one woman's granddaughter, though. She had been dating a local Chad. Her parents were against it. Of course Chad's been to jail a few times on drug and burglary charges. Given that this is Florida we're talking about, this is practically like getting your drivers license in other parts of the country. Still the guy straight up told her he wasn't going to marry her.



For her part, she did well in high school, and got a softball scholarship to go to school. Now her grandma is co-owner of a bank so she has some cash, and had put back some money to help the girl through school. Her grandparents had also bought her a car to go back and forth as long as she stayed in school. Naturally she didn't stay in school. 



She proposed to Chad. He shot her down, but kept banging her. So if she gets pregnant Chad has to marry her, right? So she got knocked up and dropped out of school. She led Grandma and Grandpa along a little bit about still being in school, and they wrote a few checks 'for tuition.' Once they worked it out, though, they cut her off and had the car towed. Grandpa bought himself a new truck with the money that was left. It's a pretty nice truck, too.



For his part, Chad still wouldn't marry her. He was still hanging around banging her, though. He also wasn't supporting her, so she had to get a job at a local fast food joint. The baby came and everything stayed status quo for about a year until the hurricane struck and wiped almost everything out, so the job was gone. Her backup plan for that was, once again, to marry Chad.  So she got knocked up a second time. Chad again declined to marry her.



So mom and daughter hatched a plan, and got some support from the local church. They set up a 'surprise wedding' to try to push Chad into 'manning up.' They had the makeshift building the church was in due to damage to the actual church all decked out, a wedding dress, and the works. So she lured Chad up there and sprung this on him. His reaction to being told what was going on was apparently 'Fuck that!' followed by a quick exit.



Chad promptly skipped town after that. I can't say I blame him on that. Imagine walking into a place like that, complete with a small crowd, and some whiteknight trying to put pressure on you. It'd be bewildering and scary at the same time. 



The consensus at the pea shelling was surprisingly even handed, though. Mostly that Chad is a thug, and he is, but that the majority of it is her fault for trying to trap him.

Honestly I was originally going to post this in relationships, or the sub for spouses of trans people, but a friend suggested here. She's hated my wife since the moment wife and I met so I honestly don't know if she's a good person to talk about this to or if she's telling me what she thinks I want to hear. The only other person I've talked to about this is my sister and she thinks we should go back to couple's therapy. Friend told me what to expect from this sub and I've been lurking for a few days; for the sake of writing I'm going to refer to my wife as ""her"", because I don't want to accidentally call her 'him' offline -that's not pleasant for anyone the occasional time I slip up. 



Call her whatever you like when you reply, she's not going to see it and I have other things to think about. 



My wife is a trans woman and came to terms with it three years ago. Told me, started transitioning and all that. I love her. This wasn't a deal breaker and we talked to a couple's therapist and honestly everything was fine except for a few issues around my pregnancy and then our newborn. (Like she wanted to jump straight to breastfeeding despite barely being into her transition; it was costly and not something, from our research, that would help our baby much if at all and would purely be for her benefit. In the end the cost made her agree to put the idea aside (but not without a lot of tears from both of us)). 



We both work full time, and the budgets tight. Neither of us have a degree and we both only make a little more then minimum wage. We weren't perfect financially before our second child was born, but things weren't so tight.



I have three bras and they're ratty sports bras that I got with my first pregnancy after I outgrew my other bras. I don't wear makeup besides a bit of mascara and colored lip-gloss, and my skin care routine is simple as is my hair routine (I cut it myself and don't dye it or anything). I'm low maintenance  partially because I can't justify buying myself a new cheap bra when that $20 could go to our debt or something the kids need or something the kids want and partially because I don't feel like I need to wear a ton of makeup or stuff like that.  



My wife is high maintenance. She gets to go to a nice salon for her hair care and waxing needs, she owns a dozen nice bras, she has a complicated skin routine, she gets to tan and get new clothes and owns way more shoes then I do.

 

We cannot afford this. 95% of our credit card debt is from her high maintenance needs. 



I was fine with it all at first; writing this off as part of the costs of transition. I realize now though, that my wife is not going to *stop* racking up credit card debt for these things she thinks she needs. I go without, because I don't feel as though anything I want like a new bra is that needed for the family to incur more debt or to pay off that less debt that month. 



Despite her eagerly embracing the ""momma bear"" attitude since practically the first moment she told me she was trans, our child care and household chore duties have barely changed at all before and after transition. She still goes to the gym straight after work while I pick up the kids and go home to make dinner. Except now she's got a really cute gym bag and exercise outfits and sends me a cute selfie or two of herself while she's there. 



She still gets home, eats dinner with us, then hangs out in the kitchen with me and the kids while I do the dishes and clean up. She tells me about her day. I like this part honestly, but I wish she would *help* because it would get done a lot faster if both of us were doing it. 



She won't mow the lawn or do the outside chores any more -it gives her mental distress to do the household activities she did before she transitioned. So now I do all those in addition to most of the inside chores. 



Last month she got mad at me for washing one of her lacy bras with my sports bras, upset enough to the point of crying and all I could do was stand there staring at this grown woman sobbing because a bit of lace came off her bra, thinking to myself ""I could have fixed it, come on, there's no need to act like this. And why is she so upset when she has four times the amount of bras then I do and hers are all much nicer than mine?"" Then I wondered why the hell I was doing her laundry, my laundry, and our children's laundry? She never does laundry.



She's literally never been alone with our children for any significant amount of time. I left her and the kids for four days last year for a friend's out of state wedding (that friend paid for, and we didn't feel comfortable asking her to pay for the whole family), and she couldn't handle that. She called her friends in so there was a friend of hers at our home with them the *entire* time. By the way, she completely dropped all of her old friends and now the only friends she has are also trans women or non-binary or whatever. So that was a fun conversation to have because I only know like two of her friends well enough to babysit my children and she can't possibly know everyone to know they're safe to have around our kids. I got called transphobic for that one, by the way. She apologized, but the very fact that's what she jumped on instead of my concerns about who is in close contact with our kids? And maybe I'm paranoid, but I was molested as a child by a family friend which she *knows*. 





Oh, and her friends...besides the two I know, everyone else just aren't very nice to me if we at a gathering or host a party. I'm treated like the help instead of the cohost. Most of them have no interest in getting to know me or even talking to me and are on the edge of rude. She doesn't see it. 



I'm so sick of it all. She won't have a real conversation, instead she just bursts into tears, has excuses or just gets mad and tells me she needs some alone time if I try to talk to her about anything.  It honestly wasn't this bad when she was my husband. 



A relative of mine left a trust fund to be given to me when I turn 30. That's in six months. The plan was to pay off all our debt, get me a new car because my current one is on its last legs, and for me to go back to school, then after I was done with school she would go back. And then, we'd take the remainder of the trust fund and move to a cheaper city to live where we would buy a house. 



Wife told me last week that she wants to be the one to go back to school first, and that she can do the stay at home mom thing while she's doing it and of course, that means she gets the new car while I'll get her current car. She also said that it'd be a good time for us to have our last baby, since she could stay home with him/her while in school after I went back to work and it'd ""practically be maternity leave""



Which stung, by the way. My current employer had me back at work three weeks after our 3 year old was born. They claimed there was an issue somewhere along the way and if I wanted to keep my job I needed to come back that soon. Probably not legal, but I was in no position to find out for sure. 



I told her that if we have the money for one of us to go back to school and stay at home with a baby, it's going to be ME. And brought up how long it took for me to fully heal from giving birth when I had to work -on top of the knowledge that I was missing out on time with our newborn. 



So instead of having an honest conversation about who should go to school and how we'd handle the trust fund money, she made it about her, and how *she* felt watching me while I was pregnant and her agony of not being able to breastfeed her baby or of knowing she could never be pregnant and on and on and how another baby that she did the majority of care for would be her chance to be a real mother. And I ended up tuning her out, wondering if she's always been this selfish and self centered or if it was new. The conversation ended with us deciding to talk about it closer to my birthday. 



Maybe it's me, I don't know, but hearing her talk about having maternity leave when I was the one who would be giving birth, dealing with all that comes with that made me angry, really honestly angry for the first time in a long time. What kind of partner would be so callous? And it dawned on me that we aren't really in a real partner ship any more. I love her, but that's just not enough any more.

Places for drug rehabilitation are strictly divided up by male and female for obvious reasons, but men who claim to identify as woman can literally get away with working in close proximity to very vulnerable women who are stuck in their beds. There were three TIMS who worked in the women's ward, one was a counselor, cook, and a nurse. To put it into perspective, there were only around 15-20 women in the ward at any given time including the employees and those in recovery. The only male you would be allowed to see (aside from the tims) would be the doctor who would prescribe meds. 



When you're going through detox, you have a night shift nurse who wakes you up a few times to check vitals. I was a bit afraid at times when I woke up that my night shift nurse got switched to the trans one who only worked for the day. The trans nurse was like the cook, over 6 ft tall and very unmistakably male. 



One of my concerns is they let TIMS in as patients (one of the woman in my group was a tif who I felt comfortable around), because otherwise you'll be trapped in a dark room unable to move due to withdrawals with a male right beside you. That's a nightmare scenario right there and I'm really glad I only had to deal with my roommate snoring loud. Given that they already allow them to work very closely with vulnerable women, I wouldn't say it's too far fetched that they would accept that.

505,2505,"I remember back when i was a libfem that I would constantly hear that being transracial isn?t okay because racial oppression leaves legacies and intergenerational trauma, whereas gender supposedly didn?t.



I?ve been thinking about that, and I... really don?t think that?s true. I absolutely believe that people from marginalized ethnicities and races have these legacies- ie not having access to large inheritance because of not getting to inherit the wealth of their ancestors, because those ancestors were slaves, barred from employment on the basis of their race, and economically shunned for their race, etc.



But I think women face similar legacies. The obvious ones being trauma- we inherit the internalized misogyny of our mothers. Like when mothers from the Middle East try to marry off their daughters when they are literal children because they were also married off young, when mothers want FGM for their daughters... for less severe cases like my mother, she passed on ideas of my being inherently stupid and useless on the basis of my sex (ie telling me girls can only pass tests if they cheat), and passing her body image issues on to me (telling me by age 13 I needed multiple plastic surgeries to look okay). So of course, I grew up with super low self esteem, thinking I was stupid, worthless, and ugly.



On more structural terms of wealth, I remember reading that women tend to get less inheritance then their male siblings. I can?t remeber the source, but at the very least I know this is true for the country my mother is from, and my grandpa said allah told him his son should get the wealth and not his daughters. 



This is ESPECIALLY visible in the workplace. All the higher paying jobs- execs, CEOs, tech, finance- are complete boys clubs who pick their own. It?s so hard for women to break in especially because of how unwelcoming and hostile it is to us. And even if it wasn?t, they are much more likely to choose fellow men. From when women first weren?t allowed to work to when they just started getting that right, men had already started their boys clubs. It was their forefathers who had these jobs, and who passed it onto men. It?s the same thing as the inheritance- except rather than passing the torch to just their blood sons, it is just to the next younger generation of men. So many competent women don?t even get considered because men have a monopoly on these jobs, and they want to keep it an exclusive field.



So while intergenerational trauma and disadvantages are not the exact same for race and sex, I believe they definitely exist for both. Not only emotionally, but also structurally. If women had been allowed to work for wages and the rights to their wages since the beginning, I don?t think men would have been able to close off so many high paying fields as boys clubs, but since they have the historical advantage and legacy, they can close these things off to women.",0,1556337416.0,bhvaae,110,GenderCritical

Even if you did not want to have a baby, it is still an extremely traumatic experience. Why, as women, do we feel we need to carry this pain alone? Why are we ashamed to talk about it?

When I was looking for stories of other women's experiences, there were so few, and usually they were from a Christian perspective (and usually from the perspective of women who wanted a baby). That is so not me. I've never told the story 100% to anyone, though I did share that it happened with friends and family because I wanted anyone who needed to know this that she is not alone. A LOT of women responded to my story with their own story. Miscarriage, whether or not a child is desired, is a tragic and traumatic event. Physically, emotionally, spiritually, etc. It changes you mentally (and physically). 



Years ago, I was living a pretty unhealthy lifestyle working graveyard shifts at a very shitty job. I was a big drinker at the time. (More than three years without a drop of alcohol today; yay!) I was drinking to get my mind off the pain of my job and my life, and the emptiness that I felt (who CAN'T relate to this?).



One day, I got this feeling. Out of nowhere. I literally SENSED that I was pregnant. I can't describe it other than I suddenly *knew* I was pregnant. At no point (except at the doctor after my miscarriage) did I take a pregnancy test. Learn from my mistakes. I avoided it until I could no longer avoid it.



I did not want to be pregnant, at all. No part of me wanted to be a mother. I was terrified. I did not want to deal with the situation whatsoever. So I decided to go into denial. But in the back of my mind, I knew. I started ""hypothetically"" looking up ways to ""deal"" with the issue, even though I had money and access to a clinic that could have assisted me in getting an abortion. I didn't want to confront it.



I found this old website, called [Sister Zeus](http://www.sisterzeus.com/List.htm) (mods, please let me know if I need to take this down due to subject matter), which had a lot of naturopathic advice on fertility, contraceptives, etc. I considered eating fuck tons of parsley to give myself an abortion, before deciding that the risks were simply too great. ""Why are you doing all this?"" I asked myself. **Because I was scared and alone.** ""You're probably wrong and not actually pregnant anyway."" Doubting my innate knowledge of my body as a woman. Society has trained us to do so. 



There is a section on there about [visualizations](http://www.sisterzeus.com/vis_list.html), which (in this context) are basically meditations or attempts to communicate with goddesses, other beings, etc. Reading them brought some comfort to me, and one of them was a visualization to [communicate with your baby](http://www.sisterzeus.com/vis_withbaby.html) (as a woman who was seeking an abortion). 



Me, being a total atheist, but also totally desperate... I closed my eyes, relaxed, and ""communicated"" with my ""baby."" I told it that I was not ready to be a mother. I was not responsible enough. I did not want that. I wanted its soul to stay up in the heavens/Olympus/purgatory/paradise/nirvana/wherever, for a little while longer. Or maybe forever. I begged and pleaded and apologized, feeling completely insane and desperate. *I'm not ready. I don't want to have a baby.* I cried. 



I was so scared.



***I am going to get graphic here. So few miscarriage stories explain the gory details but women need to know what this entails. We need to be prepared and aware.***



A few nights later, I became very tired and took a nap on the couch. Then I woke up in complete agony late at night, around 1:00a.m. My stomach was killing me. It felt like the worst period ever, but there was this intermittent pulsing feeling. I immediately realized that that was a contraction. I knew for sure that I was pregnant now, and didn't want to believe it, but could no longer run away from the truth.  



I went to the restroom and there was blood EVERYWHERE. I have never seen so much blood in one place. I wondered if I actually was not pregnant and was just internally bleeding and about to die. Also, many bowel movements were happening at the same time. I see now why people warn pregnant women that they may take a shit on the table. 



I was crying and in pain and scared. At this point, I finally woke my male partner up and explained to him that I was pretty sure I was having a miscarriage. He did not want to believe it either. I had never mentioned any of this to him. It just felt like it was between me and my body and I didn't want to bring a man into it.



This was going on for hours. Three, I think. I wanted it to just end. I never considered going to the hospital because Google had said that it usually wasn't necessary for miscarriages. (I'm not advocating for approaching the situation this way, just explaining what I did.)



At some point, I had this overwhelming urge to get into the bath. I filled a bath up and got in it. It immediately turned dark red. It looked like a suicide attempt. I felt a little better, though, but I was still in serious pain and the contractions were happening faster and faster. It occurred to me that, if I was standing, maybe gravity would help move things along. So, I turned on a warm shower and stood underneath it. Blood was running down my legs, all over the bathtub, there was a strange smell of... birth? Pregnancy? I don't know, one I did not recognize. Coming from my body. I was crying and having a hard time processing what was going on. 



All of the sudden, I felt something much larger than any period discharge give way and come out of me in a rush. I screamed. The... fetus, baby, mass of cells, whatever it was, came out of me. I ""gave birth,"" or whatever. 



I jumped out of the bathtub. I couldn't face it. I couldn't look at the life that I begged to leave me. I told my husband I would clean it up, but I couldn't do it. I ran out of the room crying, with many pads in my underwear because I was still bleeding a lot (I did not wear tampons for a VERY long time after this). He ended up picking up the organism, washing it off and looking at it. I never looked at it. I asked him once what it looked like, a long time later, and he said it looked like a small triangle, and not a baby.



After that, I went to sleep.



The next morning I called a gynecologist that I hadn't seen in years, explaining that I had a miscarriage and I needed to be checked out. When I said ""miscarriage,"" they immediately found a spot in their schedule for me later in the day, even though they were usually booked out awhile. I brought myself to go. The doctors were all very polite; nobody apologized for my loss or anything like that, but they were gentle with me. I finally got a pregnancy test. I was, indeed, pregnant. The doctor assessed (not sure how) that I was at about 18-20 weeks. He said that, based on my description of how the event happened, the fetus was likely never going to be viable no matter what I did. Basically, he wanted to preempt any thoughts I may have had that it was ""my fault."" (Not that it worked, though looking back, I feel neutral about this situation. I do not carry guilt.) He said I may need to go in one day to get a D&C if the miscarriage did not expel all of the tissue, but that ended up not being necessary.



I called my boss and explained what happened and he gave me one day off. Awesome! (Fucking asshole.)



That is the story of my miscarriage. 



I sometimes wonder a little about the visualizations. Am I being naive by being an atheist? Was I actually communing with some spiritual being who heeded my call to not let me have a baby? Why would I get what I wanted, but other women in worse situations still have a baby? Or women who want children find themselves unable to do so? How does it all work? Is it all completely arbitrary?

To explain sexism feminists could attempt to build a story that casually connects things like chromosomes, hormones, or socialisation with the prevalence of sexist behaviour in men. 



However if we blamed men's sexist behaviour on chromosomes, hormones, or socialisation then we are saying that what exists in men that makes them sexist (and justifies feminist criticism, action, and segregation from them) also exists in ""transwomen"". As far as the feminist project is concerned this would make many transwomen indistinguishable from men. To explain the behaviour of transwomen we would say that they are men and thereby contradict their identy claims. 



[Note: any transactivists who admits that they had male privilege, or were socialised as a man has already contradicted their own identy claims]



The only way the transactivism and feminism could be compatible is if we blamed sexism on the fact that men ""identify as"" men (that is to say that they believe they are men or feel like men). Referencing any other type of explanation for men's sexism would necessarily import a transphobia into feminist theory.



However, we know that socialisation and biology do play a role in behaviour. We also know that whatever the explanation for men's sexist behaviour is, it will be more complicated than 'men are sexist towards women because they feel like men she believe they are men'.

It absolutely does not characterize my feelings about gender in any way. I do not identify with women?s oppression or femininity. Rather, I feel those things are imposed on an unwilling me by society. 



I think the better way to describe myself and many so-called ?cis? people is that we?re gender integrated. 



I have taken all the aspects of me that are stereotypically feminine combined them with the traits and interests that are stereotypically masculine and have created one personality.



That personality happens to reside in a female body, thus I am merely female. It doesn?t matter how I present, people will still see me as female. 



Gender-integration is how normal people deal with aspects of themselves that aren?t stereotypical for their gender and I think it?s the optimum treatment for people with gender dysphoria.



Instead of changing their identities on ID, I think they should be counselled into accepting themselves as they are.



So you?re a man who likes dresses, makeup and heels. So what? Integrate those preferences into your manhood. Make wearing a dress an acceptable masculine endeavour. This is why I support men who admit they?re men but like cross dressing?they?re honest about themselves, they?re honest about why they cross dress and they own their manhood. 



After all, I can integrate my love of sports, power tools, politics, gaming, technology, jogging pants, running shoes, sweatshirts?all stereotypical male interests?into my femininity so why can?t some men integrate their feminine interests into their masculinity?



It all comes back to misogyny and the desire to gatekeep masculinity by refusing to let feminine things gain popularity among men. Look at how women are better able to branch out into masculine endeavours but men are still constrained by rigid expectations of manhood.



It?s only when men allow the stereotypically  feminine to become acceptable for men that women can achieve equality.



TiMs have rigid world views about what makes a man and what makes a woman; they think there?s something wrong about a person who tries to live beyond their gender roles. They think it?s so wrong that they can?t tolerate themselves as men with feminine interests so they try to live as women instead.



If these TiMs didn?t view femininity as weak and pathetic, they would be happy to integrate their femininity into their masculinity.



That?s why gender integration should be the goal. Trans people should receive robust education about gender stereotypes and the harm they cause and learn to accept themselves as they are. 



When I was a child, we were taught that girls could do boy things and boys could do girl things. Girls quickly seized on this and began doing boy things but boys didn?t because they have been trained to see femininity as negative. 



In truth though, most men accept the feminine parts of themselves and just integrate it into their manhood.

I have had cases in the past where a new bride's mother in law will treat her like absolute shit, one of these cases involved actually locking her in a room for hours on end and starving her because she had not done all the ironing in the home.

She wants the kids to go to a certain school? Done! She even has ultimate veto power over all our names when children are born. As the oldest living relative in our line, she commands a huge amount of authority... but of course uses it to reinforce gender roles completely, completely fawning over the men whilst criticising their wives for never being good enough, for not cooking more, etc. I see women in my family then raising *their* sons this way, fawning over them whilst treating their daughters like some kind of servant, and of course when their sons get married their wives are treated as being totally disposable, just another cook/cleaner which he can replace if she angers him.

We mean it literally, following directly from their own descriptions of being misgendered.  



It is often described as this: Being ?misgendered? reminds the person that they are not and will never be the opposite sex and that triggers extreme sadness and disgust at that fact (and at their body for being the way it is that that fact is true) aka dysphoria.  We can accept that this might be true.

553,2553,"So the gist of the original story is that a man twice my age approached me in a parking lot because he wanted to talk about the cool car I was driving. I made some small talk with him about it, and then I tried to leave. He got really sexual and I made it clear I was a 17 year old and NOT interested in him. I made it explicitly clear. I also told him I had a boyfriend (which I did). He told me he was in his 30s and that I needed to try out an older man because he saw nothing wrong with me being 17. He said it wasn?t fair that I looked so much older. He asked me about 4 different ways for my number. He tried to get me to get in his car to ?go for a ride?. I told him that I didn?t like it, and my dad and boyfriend sure as hell wouldn?t. Anyway, it just escalated and he just kept begging for me to ?give him a chance? and he got creepier and more sexual. I got home that night and found him on Instagram and Facebook and found that he has several small children, including daughters, and a girlfriend. I blocked him on all platforms just to be safe. Never once was I a tease. He was the one who got gross really fast and wanted to talk about everything but cars. 



So I was pretty shaken up by the whole encounter and I thought I could get some support over on 2x chromosomes because I figured they supported young girls who look way older who get preyed on by older men. Boy was I wrong. I don?t think one female commented, it was just a barrage of attacks from men. Claiming that it?s not their fault that I?m in my sexual prime and it?s just human nature to be sexually attracted to almost legal girls. They said I was a tease and I had no right to be upset by the encounter. They said nothing would?ve happened. It was all my fault apparently. Then the ?NoT aLl MeN? comments came. It turned into such a charlie foxtrot that I just deleted whole entire post.

555,2555,"I?m writing this because of another woman?s post the other day here about her boyfriend?s pornography addiction because it reminded me of how much I struggled with past boyfriends? pornography use and how much that warped my perception of myself, of men and women. I don?t feel like there are many spaces on reddit where I can actually speak about this, but I believe this is a place where I can (or at least I hope I can). 



To preface, I?m a heterosexual woman and I?m multi racial (like really mixed up), but I pretty much look like I?m half Asian and Hispanic (I?m not Hispanic, but whatever). I mention this because it?s relevant to the porn thing. 



So, I was partially raised by my abusive biological mother until I was sort of unofficially adopted by a former teacher and her family when I was 13. My biological mom was a stereotypical ?man hater? ? she had been severely sexually and physically abused by her father as a child, so naturally she really didn?t have the best views about men or people more generally. I?m not going to delve into how she was abusive to me much (she?s a narcissist) because it isn?t relevant to this, but I was basically raised to believe that men were either predators or abusers or absolute dogs. That all men were hotly sexually wired to the point where they could never be satisfied with just one woman (regardless of how beautiful she was), that they would always have to look to external means to satisfy their urges, and that this was perfectly natural and that if I wasn?t comfortable with it I was just being insecure. ?Good? men didn?t cheat on their wives or girlfriends, instead they used porn to satisfy themselves and again, this was all perfectly natural and something that I would just have to accept. This was all normal and natural. 



My problem? I could never accept it. The thing is, I WAS insecure ? I was a model, I was mixed race, I struggled with body dysmorphia, gender dysphoria at times and I had a severe eating disorder for years. I was able to recognize all of these insecurities and I tried (and still try) to overcome them, but the only ?insecurity? I really couldn?t rationalize or treat was my ?insecurity? with my boyfriends using porn. I always thought to myself, ?if I can be satisfied with only him, why can he never be satisfied with just me?? Some might laugh at this, but I used to wish I was a lesbian because I seriously believed that only women were truly capable of being trustworthy, committed and sexually honest.



I just wanted to be enough. I never felt enough in so many ways, intellectually and physically, and as I tried to battle my own issues I still could never reach that part where I was genuinely okay with my boyfriend using porn. It was deeply upsetting. When I was 18, I was in a relationship with a guy who was also my best friend, and I have no doubt that he loved me, but he couldn?t stop his porn use. Specifically, he was obsessed with black and Asian porn, which made me feel even more uncomfortable (I was always like, you get the *real* thing and that still doesn?t work?) He genuinely believed that I shouldn?t have had a problem with him watching porn, and that once I worked more on my sense of self worth that we would move past this and it would no longer be a problem. Well, it didn?t work. We were together for three years.



I dated other men. A lot of them had an Asian fetish, thought I was ?exotic? for being mixed, only watched WoC porn and only dated WoC so they thought they weren?t racist (readers here probably know who I mean), etc. I could never really connect, and I greatly struggled with maintaining romantic connections because the ?porn? issue always came up. And if it wasn?t porn, it was some other way of objectifying women that turned me off.



Eventually, I met a man and he was, shockingly, not like ?men.? He didn?t watch porn. He didn?t objectify women. He didn?t objectify women of color. He was legitimately a regular human and he treated me like a real person. This relationship also didn?t last, but I think it?s important to mention because it was a real turning point for me and made me question some deeply sick, misogynistic beliefs that I had held about men and women for so long. I thought, ?if this guy exists, and he doesn?t use porn, and he?s not sexually repressed and is for all intents and purposes a well adjusted human being... maybe I?ve been living a lie??



And I had been. I had been living this lie that all men were perverted and that women absolutely had to put up with their shit because they couldn?t ?fix? their biology, and to take away their porn would be crazy and abusive. I lived with that lie for 24 years. I lived with this lie that EVERYONE was a certain way, and that I just had to accept it and that there was something deeply wrong with me for not accepting it. Turns out, I and the people who told me these things were full of shit. A lot of shit.



The thing is, men and people are not hardwired to want/need to fuck everything that walks. Men who respect women and their partners do not need to satisfy their ?extra sexual? urges with pornography or other erotic materials. That is a lie. You do not have to change yourself to fit into this narrative. As I got older, I met plenty of other folks who had been in the same boat and with enough experience began to realize that this was all bullshit, too. There are men out there who will want you and only you because they are secure in themselves and in their sexuality and you are enough. You shouldn?t have to put up with anything else.



I realize this was kind of a ramble, but I wanted to post this because I genuinely feel empathy for the girl who made that post about her boyfriend the other day. What he is doing to her is not natural, should not be accepted, and should not be taught to future boys or girls. Pornography is a symptom of a sick society that does not value women nor healthy, fulfilling relationships for women (or men, for that matter). 



Currently, I?m in a relationship with another man who has zero interest in porn, knows that it?s exploitation of women, doesn?t use porn and we have a healthy sex life and I am genuinely happy with this. It is still hard for me at times to accept that not all men are massive porn addicts or are secretly pining for sex from other women, but I do know the truth now and life is a lot better because of it. I seriously only wish the best for those who are currently struggling with porn addicted partners, or porn addiction themselves.

556,2556,"So I'm a TIF, and I do plan on transitioning as after several years of repressing, I realised that transitioning is going to be best for my dysphoria. However, I really hate the trans community and I want to separate myself from it entirely. The amount of violence and abuse TIFs will get from TIMs is disgusting, and what's worse is no one will do anything about it.



My experience with this was being groomed by a TIM quite a bit older than me after I left my abusive home situation and was very clearly vulnerable. They always pressured me into doing sexual shit with them, and one time sexually assaulted and tbh almost raped me while I was asleep, after they had got me very drunk. When I tried to tell people about this, I was labelled a transmisogynist because TIMs are more oppressed than TIFs, and I somehow had male privilege over this person, despite me clearly not holding any privilege that a male would have as I am female bodied, and seen as female in society. People even went as far to say that this person meant no harm, but they have a history of this sort of behaviour towards vulnerable female people.



Unfortunately, this isn't an uncommon thing. There's so many abusive TIMs in the community, and they're usually high up. TIFs can't do anything about it because we're labelled as having a position of power over them (we don't) and that we're exactly the same as cis men (we aren't.) After taking a lot of time to think about this, I am sure this is rooted in misogyny. It disgusts me that these people hold so much power and abuse it.



Because of this, I have decided to be a whole lot less open about being trans, and I'm avoiding the community as a whole. They're so toxic, and I am sick of the oppression I face as a female person being swept under the carpet, and being told I'm evil and oppressing males for daring to speak out about it.",-1,1556232573.0,bhf0z5,86,GenderCritical

So basically like the title says, for MONTHS I found out my boyfriend (33 years old) looks at porn in the shower right before he comes out and we usually have sex. Literally nearly every time.



It's hurt my feelings. It makes me feel weird that he's looking at other women and then comes over to me. It just felt deceptive. If I knew he was doing that, of course I wouldn't be in the mood to then have sex. But I didn't know this whole time, so obviously I couldn't express that I'm not in the mood.



So I brought it up to him. He assures me it was just a weird habit he formed and it doesn't mean anything. That he's no getting aroused when he was watching porn. But obviously guys look at porn because they want to watch porn they get off to right? It's not like he's looking at gay porn.



It's really hurt my confidence. Has anyone ever dealt with this? How did you work through this? The fact that he looks at other girls and then comes to me just makes me feel so gross.



I just don't get it because he gets mad at me if I interact with a male friend that he observes is too ""friendly"". Even though nothing sexual is happening. It's all platonic.

I'm gonna use the preferred pronouns thing, cuz this is already being a drama and not make me more confused.

So, I don't really belive in trans anything, first because I truly belive that if we lived in a world without gender stereotypes (as I want and preach), we wouldn't have anyone claiming to be transgender, and second that I think that any dysmorphia is a disease and should be treated as one. We can't say a gir with anorexia it's not fine and then accept other things.

Now to my problem: me and another ""friend"" talked to him about his trans status, and he refuses to seek a psychologist because he does not want to anyone asking if he is sure about being a boy, despite the fact that he claims that he only knew for sure when he was 16, so last year. It's been clear to me and this other friend that he is not secure in he's decision to start transitioning, specifically, as our culture basically demands, he lives with his father THAT DOES NOT KNOW, and he said he's not going to tell his father, that he plan to simply start transitioning and that his dad will have to confront him or he wont tell, cuz he feel that he can't tell him. I keep thinking how would that work, as he start growing a beard out of nowhere while living with his strict christian active military man, that presumed that his daughter was a butch lesbian as they never talked about it, anything. Basically this kid is raising himself, so he doesn't have enough real life experience or maturity, you know? Me and this other friend, basically the only people that he really talks about this trans things, have a habit to misgender anyone and everyone, I've have been know to misgender myself and even my husband, that is so usual with me, that my highly homophobic FIL (that type that would make hell break lose if someone says anything about him being a manly man and straight) doesn't care anymore when I do it... But not him, if I say 7 gendered(?) adjectives for him, and ONE OF SEVEN is feminine, he gets midly offended and corrects me. He even decided to not use the free treatment for """"""""reassignment"""""""" my country government offers, because that would mean that he would have mandatory therapy, and he does not want to have anyone asking if he's sure he's trans, he prefers to pay out of pocket with a money he does not have so he skip out on therapy.

And how is this all my problem you ask? He's bugging me to help him change his gender on official documents (he have a really neutral name, so is going to keep it), and I really don't want to because of all of the things above.

*Should a person who feels his legal age does not correspond with his experienced age be allowed to change his legal age? In this paper, I argue that in some cases people should be allowed to change their legal age. Such cases would be when: 1) the person genuinely feels his age differs significantly from his chronological age and 2) the person?s biological age is recognized to be significantly different from his chronological age and 3) age change would likely prevent, stop or reduce ageism, discrimination due to age, he would otherwise face. I also consider some objections against the view that people should be allowed to change their legal age and find them lacking.*

It occurred to me today that several times when I've tried to network with men it has ended badly and I've lost out on work opportunities and have been sexually harassed instead. It got me thinking, this must happen to women everywhere. And that means women's careers everywhere are being stunted by men doing this to them. My examples are:



&#x200B;



1. I went on a work related workshop and asked the man running it if his company had any vacancies in my particular field. He said he thought they might and said he could pass my details onto the hiring manager so I gave him my phone number. He was really encouraging about my work and was an educated 'left wing' man who is much respected in his community so I didn't think twice about giving him my information. We also shared some mutual contacts. A few days later he started texting me saying how great my work was and did I want to meet up to go to another industry related event. I agreed before realising it seemed date-like then politely declined. He then kept messaging me and invited me out 6 more times for meals and to concerts (ie. not work related) and even sent post to my address which he accessed from his company database. He told me that he had 'never met a woman like me before' and made it clear he wanted to date. I had to tell him to stop contacting me and of course lost out on work  opportunities at his workplace which I would have really liked to do.

2. I went to this restaurant on my own in the daytime and brought some of my work. I'd been a few times before and the male owner seemed ok. One time he was there with some of his friends and they asked me about my work. We had a chat about it and the owner said he knew someone in my industry who might have an opportunity. So I left my number. He then started texting me saying that I looked like a certain celebrity and invited me to go to his restaurant after closing. Yuck, yuck yuck. Another potential work opportunity lost plus I now avoid going anywhere near that restaurant (although I'm starting to think these opportunities are none existent and just an excuse to get a phone number).

3. Years ago I was matched with an older male mentor by an organisation. He set up a meeting with a company he knew. They liked my work but tried to persuade me to work for free. They all referred to the talented and professional women in their office as 'girls.' It had a really sexist atmosphere and I felt uncomfortable. I told them that I don't work for free and all of them including the mentor were angry with me and told me I was making a mistake. I ended the mentorship and found a female mentor instead who agreed with me that it was totally exploitative of them to expect free work. But it meant another work opportunity lost as this was a huge firm plus just a big waste of time.

4. I did an internship and the manager promised to pay for my travel and food (no salary). He conveniently forgot until I ended up writing to him demanding it. This guy was absolutely loaded driving round in a really expensive car and he spent hardly any time in the office. The work he tried to get me to do was unethical. I left feeling very disappointed, exploited and lied to, yet again.

5. In a past job I was given a promotion over this man who worked there. People used to take it in turns to make the team coffee. Whenever it was his turn he never asked me if I wanted a drink and used to make coffee for everyone except me when I always made him coffee alongside everyone else. I found this to be remarkably petty and bitter behaviour.

I have had trouble with various women I've worked with too, so I'm under no impression we are all angels in the slightest. But one thing they don't do is stalk and harass me and try to get me to date them. I've been to a women's networking event and it was so much better. Genuinely great, talented and supportive women. I think it's the only way forward because too many men see the phone number or email address of a woman as an invitation to harass her for sexual involvement or they see her as free or cheap labour. It's made me realise that we really haven't advanced that much as a society and in many ways and women are still held back loads in apparently modern westernised society.

I cried because it must have been hard for her, to believe she'd have to do such a thing. When I finally visited, her and her girlfriend bombarded me with questions about my sexual preference and gender identity. I refused to answer because why the fuck should I?

I didn't know what most, if not all, TRAs stand for: death upon women who held different opinions than them, for women's spaces and rights to be invaded, for words and biology to be redefined so everyone can suit their needs, and for fucking children, fucking children for god's sake, to mutilate their young, developing bodies and minds to 'transition' when they're children who are exploring their very being. 



&#x200B;



It got even worse when I further noticed celebrities, charities, politicians, people with huge platforms, millions and millions of followers, endorsing this nonsense, only ever showcasing the ""positive"" and afraid to delve deeper into the negative, afraid to realize that Trans Rights only bring biological women several steps backwards. Even ""scientists"" and ""doctors"" endorse this shit, so they can freely experiment.

I see people promoting cosmetic surgery, giving away their money to beggars and charities that benefit these mentally ill people, who honestly think if they don't receive surge they'll die, and now there are even people who state they're trans, but won't ever transition. Just trans, just because there is nothing special about them.

661,2661,"My parents have been telling me that my life's purpose is to have children ever since I was born (or so it feels like). A few years ago, I had been through absolute hell because my mom was desperate for grandchildren (she now has a grandson from one of my younger sisters). I grew up in a place in which most women become mothers at 20-22, and the general attitude is that you're not supposed to start having kids later because then you can't have as many kids. 



I'm now almost 24, and while I do not officially declare myself childfree (nor do I have any children), the expectation for women to have children has pretty much ruined my life. I don't want to go into too much detail, but I was harassed and emotionally abused and name called because I didn't want to have children at an early age. 



I was arguing with some anti-choice people a while back, and at one point one of them said: ""Women's mental health doesn't matter."" That really hurt because that's pretty much what my parents said to me (both if them are officially pro-choice but that didn't stop them) and what I have been taught growing up in my community. They told me that my current happiness doesn't matter because I'll be even more unhappy in the future if I don't have kids immediately. 



And I have an anti-choice coworker who frequently says ""those women can just give their kids up for adoption."" The fact that some women have zero sympathy when it comes to other women disturbs me. She's basically saying, ""She doesn't have to raise the child against her will, but she has to give birth against her will.""



I was also taught growing up that it's ""selfish"" to not want children. I'm sorry, but I think it's a lot more ""selfish"" to pressure other women into having children against their will. 



And what disturbs me so much is that a lot of people who say that they're ""pro-choice"" will defend surrogacy. Like is it suddenly okay to coerce a woman into giving birth as long as you pay for it? Do they not see how messed up that is? And they say ""it's a choice"" and ""they enjoy it,"" but money is coercion and pregnancy is an unhealthy ""hobby,"" unlike knitting or gardening. 



A while back, I made a post on here about men who claim that men are ""attracted to signs of fertility"" and how that's bullshit since hairlessness and smooth skin aren't signs of fertility. What disturbs me is that men would start telling me these things after I would go on a body positive monologue or something. They would say ""body positivity is bullshit since men are attracted to signs of fertility."" If not meeting current beauty standards were actually a sign of infertility, wouldn't that be even more of a reason to be body positive? What these men are basically saying is: ""Your self worth is determined by your fertility and so you can't enjoy anything if it means that you're infertile."" 



I was actually crying yesterday about how women aren't allowed  to have autonomy over our reproductive systems. Even some of the most ""leftist"" (and I put ""leftist"" in quotes because they aren't real leftists) people I know will defend surrogacy. Like there's no escape from any of this. And I only covered a small fraction of the ways in which women are exploited for their reproductive systems. 



And this is part of the reason why I'm angry every single time I see TiMs with a pregnancy fetish. They will never go through what women go through because of our reproductive systems.

I thought other left, gender-critical feminists might find it buoying to see this fundamental but constantly ignored point being made about how adopting gender identity ideology undermines the validity of class analysis.

*The fact that much of the left unquestioningly accepts and regurgitates an ideology in which the subjective feelings of the individual trump objectively observable conditions is a sign that we have abandoned the physical, material reality on which our politics is based, and replaced it with a subjective individualism that is alien to any class-based analysis.*

Hormones and social conditioning etc are not independent of neurodevelopment and neural plasticity might mean that any differences are linked to that those factors rather than just XX or XY but that would still result in sex differences in adult brains right? I work in mental health with a particular interest in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and how these affect girls. When we know that there are sex differences in mental health outcomes and prevalence, in behaviors like aggression and in the behavioral expression of the same genotypes I struggle to see how there can be 0 differences across sexes.",1,1555945340.0,bg344q,34,GenderCritical

686,2686,"A few members in a previous post were discussing the unlikelihood of women to change ideologies from gender critical to trans positive. However, sometimes I do doubt myself.



It is generally in the face of friends, colleagues, and people I respect who consider themselves to be ""nonbinary"" to some degree. I am in a field where this is perhaps more common to encounter. But the thing is, I love these people and I want to support them. They are good people, smart people, not anyone that I would want to come into conflict with or emotionally hurt. I want these people to succeed and be happy with themselves and present as ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" as they want. And I don't think that this desire is diametrical to GCF.



But I know that if my colleagues *knew* that am GC that it would hurt them. And I wonder if it is more important to be kind and supportive or to stick to my commitment to women's liberation. I don't want it to be this clash where it must be women's rights or trans rights, I really am bothered that they collide (although, that's why we are labelled TERFs, I know). But what I come back to is the old homophobic, Christian adage of ""love the sinner, hate the sin."" This is what I feel I am doing when I am kind and affirming to transgender people in my life, but support GC causes in my private life. It makes me feel like a hypocrite and a jerk.

687,2687,"I've been lurking on trans/trans-dominant subs this past week. I wanted to get their side of the issue. I wanted to see if I am truly being a bigoted bitch or if there is real cause for alarm. Here's what I found:  



The best argument they had: We, GCFs, are never satisfied with how they present themselves. That if they dress in the caricature-like femme-bot way, we find it offensive and if they don't do anything to make themselves more ""feminine"" (esp. in public bathrooms) then we say ""Look the MF didn't even bother to present as a female!""  



They're absolutely right. I personally don't accept a man in a women's restroom or locker room whether or not he presents himself as ""feminine"" or not. A mother can bring her 16 yr old son in with her and I won't bat a lash, but a solo male is going to get some side-looks. What they're ignoring, other than biology and reality, is that GCFs don't acknowledge that it is possible to change one's biological sex period and that men have taught us not to trust men that go into women's bathrooms and locker rooms.  



That was the best argument I can honestly say I saw. Not once on any of the trans-dominant subs I visited did I find...  



... any consideration of actual GCF/women's concerns.  



...None of them considered how unfair it is for girls that want to participate in sports.  



...None of them considered the emotional repercussions to girls in schools that allow this bathroom/locker room nonsense.  



...None of them would even admit that it's even a little selfish to leave loopholes for sexual predators to gain easier access to traumatize women and girls just so that they can feel validated.

When they addressed specific threads on r/GenderCritical the majority of them were personal rants by people that had just recently peaked or just finding out about the whole trans movement; in other words, opinion/rant pieces where the author didn't bother with statistics or studies and were just getting shit off their chest.

To be frank, we have a lot of problems and should probably be in therapy. But I digress. Tonight my boyfriend brought up a comment I made in a Facebook group. I was responding to a question that asked, 'What's an unpopular opinion of yours?' I said that trans-men are probably lesbians and trans-women are just dudes. I thought it was in poor taste and unnecessarily harsh without nuance, so I quickly deleted it. Or so I thought. The comment wasn't deleted and my boyfriend saw it. He brought it up to me and was extremely upset about it. I just said 'sorry I thought I deleted it' to which he responded with loaded questions. ""Is this what you really think? Do you really hate trans people?"" I just sat there in silence, quietly apologizing after he said things like ""I love you but I'm so embarrassed by you,"" and so on. He told me that he doesn't want me browsing subreddits like GenderCritical anymore. Which isn't a bad suggestion. I've been meaning to spend less time surfing the web anyway.

But I have serious doubts regarding the transgender movement and its implications. When I met my boyfriend in 2014, he was questioning whether he was transgender or not.

I don?t expect trans people to have to lie about their identity, and they shouldn?t, but it?s too much to ask for others to consider them the opposite sex. They should accept that they?re considered their birth sex and accept the label of non-conforming because it?s accurate. 



It?s just not realistic to expect others to consider you the opposite sex when your appearance, behaviour and history clearly show you?re not.

I know I?m conflating sex and gender here but isn?t that what we?re being asked to do these days? I mean we?re expected to literally consider men as women and women as men. What about non-binary people? Are we supposed to assume they have no sex whatsoever? Would that make them flat-chested or breasted? What kind of appearance are we supposed to use as a mental reference for non-binary? What does non-binary look like? How are we supposed to identify that to say it?



I have concluded we?re not supposed to be able to make these IDs and judgments on our own. 



Rather, we?re supposed to just do and say whatever trans people tell us. If TRAs say someone is female, we are just supposed to play along. Same if they say they?re male, same if they call themselves non-binary or another non-sensical gender.

An Ohio Republican has proposed legislation to change state child exploitation law, in response to a nine-year-old boy?s drag performance at a local bar which sparked an online furor after video was published by a fringe conservative website.



The video shows the boy, who performs as Miss Mae Hem, in a pink leotard doing cartwheels, splits and a classic drag move called a death drop, which involves falling down.



The state representative Tim Schaffer?s bill would expand the definition of child endangering to stop businesses with liquor licenses holding performances in which a ?child simulates sexual activity?.



Schaffer said in a statement he was introducing the bill because of a video featuring Miss Mae Hem, which he said showed the child performing a ?provocative sexually explicit dance routine?.



In the video, which runs about four minutes, Miss Mae Hem performs dance moves common to children?s dance classes as well as vogueing, a traditional drag dance style that is not inherently sexual. The performer also collects money from a cheering audience.



Miss Mae Hem, whose real name is Jacob Measley, had been performing in and around Toledo for more than a year before sparking the ire of local politicians.



The furor seems to have started with a Facebook post that claimed to be by the city of Lancaster, where the performance took place, but was actually made by an imposter account.



Mayor David Scheffler said the Facebook page that complained about the performance was ?in no way affiliated with the City of Lancaster?.



?There have been serious threats of violence resulting from this post,? Scheffler said. ?Let us hope and pray that no harm comes to person or property as a result of it.?



A video was also shared by Christian Journal Media, a conservative website whose editor-in-chief, Rich Penkoski, frequently campaigns against drag queens. Penkoski is a minister for the fringe Warriors for Christ ministry, which denounces most Christians and Catholics.



In an interview with the Toledo Blade, Jacob Measley?s mother, Jerri Measley, said her family?s intentions have been ?grossly warped?. City police investigated complaints about the video but found no violation of state law or city ordinance. Measley said child protective services visited her home.



?Jacob is just a guy who likes to dress up and dance and feel pretty,? she said. ?It?s kind of like Halloween every time he has the opportunity to do it.?



She said she understood why some people might object to her son performing in a bar, but said they were among the only venues where people could explore drag culture.



?Where else is there right now for children who identify as being in the LGBT community to explore that interest?? Measley asked.



A Democratic lawmaker in Ohio, Teresa Fedor, told the Toledo Blade she supported Schaffer?s bill and said: ?When we?re trying to prevent human trafficking from happening, especially the commercial, sexual exploitation of children, I don?t see how this is not very closely related to that issue ? that concept of a rape culture where we?re normalizing this type of activity.?



It is becoming more common for children to show an interest in drag culture, in part because of the wild success of the reality TV show RuPaul?s Drag Race. It is in its 11th season. Its 10th season, in 2018, had a record overall viewership of 723,000.",0,1555852851.0,bfoq8w,79,GenderCritical
701,2701,"I went to college from 2006-2011, and in that time I saw a huge shift in the kinda queer feminist spaces that I hung out in.  In my early years of college, I was friends with a variety of women who wore different clothes, and we were activists for things like abortion rights, fighting the patriarchy, rape on campus, FGM.  There was one FTM trans person, who bound his breasts and preferred male pronouns, and I never really thought anything about it.  



Around 2010, things really changed. Everything became about ""Hi, I'm \_\_\_ and my preferred pronouns are they, xi, them.""  Ooook.  If we tried to talk about women's issues such as abortion or FGM, it ""wasn't inclusive for women without vaginas.""  The biggest activism became getting hormonal therapy to trans people in prison.  



I'm going to try to lay out my main concerns:



1. There is a finite amount of time and space for discussion and activism, and I feel now that the amount of time dealing with trans issues is not proportional to the amount of people affected.  I do think that dysphoric people face some major issues, but on a global scale, there are just so many more women who are facing problems that come from having a vagina.

2. I do not understand ""feeling like a woman,"" because I have never once felt that way.  The only thing that makes me feel like a woman is the fact that I have a vagina and the gender roles that have been taught to me because of that.  I see sex and I see gender roles, but wtf actually is ""gender"" as this intrinsic state of being woman? 

3. There's like this oppression Olympics kinda thing going around in the spaces where I used to feel most comfortable, and I feel like just identifying as trans in some way now is used to grant people a power to speak over others.  I don't feel comfortable voicing my concerns or opinions anymore, and have gotten ""called out"" (as they say) for saying something transphobic (again, I think this was when I said abortion is a women's rights issue). 

4. I don't understand why a lot of trans people say things like ""I am a woman because I just AM a woman"" and wear feminine clothes, but then a second later say things like, ""As a trans person, I think...""  It seems more like identifying as being a transwoman than a woman, but idk.

5. I don't really care about using preferred pronouns if they make someone feel more comfy living in a gendered world, although ""they"" is just like argh.  My main issues are with the systemic underlying premises and effects, not with problems on a person-to-person basis.",-1,1555851913.0,bfolk2,47,GenderCritical

This is nonsense - Karen White, a TIM, sexually assaulted two women in a mother and baby unit, and prison experts warned the government that manipulative trans prisoners were trying to game the system to get access to women only spaces.

The Guardian also bizarrely claims that anti trans rhetoric comes from the alt right, and 'some feminists' who argue that biology is destiny. This is a complete misrepresentation of the gender critical position: gender critical feminists do NOT think that biology is destiny. The Guardian managed to report the precise opposite of what gender critical feminists actually believe.

Last month, [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/joannachiu/status/1110079640998023168?s=12) detailing a woman?s observation of a man who appeared to be in his late 30s sexually harassing a teenage girl during a flight went viral. Joanna Chiu, a Canadian journalist who was sitting in the row in front of them, had planned to get some sleep during an overnight flight, but ?couldn?t avoid noticing what was going on in the row behind me.?



The man started by asking the teenage girl about what career she?d like to pursue, laughing when the girl replied she hoped to be a CEO, Chiu tweeted. The man soon became very familiar, Chiu recounted, teasing the girl and asking to take her out to eat, which the girl ignored. ?At this point I had to stay awake in case anything went further than that,? Chiu tweeted.



Chiu monitored the conversation, and ultimately intervened when the man asked the young girl for a ?dirty? photo. A woman seated in the row behind the girl had also been monitoring the situation and offered the girl support. The women got the attention of the flight crew, and with much resistance from the man, they eventually managed to force him to move seats.



?But none of the male passengers seemed to show they noticed what was going on. Maybe fellow women are more likely to pick up on warning signs early on in the conversation because we used to be teenage girls too?? Chiu tweeted, going on to recount her own experiences as a young girl travelling alone and the male passengers who had spoken to her inappropriately and forced a kiss on her without her consent.



From online discussions like these and others, mainstream society is slowly awakening to the fact that a majority of women move through the world in a constant, heightened state of awareness.



Sadia Saeed, a psychologist and founder of Inner Space Counseling in Mumbai, recounts the ways she has heard women talk about staying vigilant about their surroundings ? paying attention to ?whether we?re being watched or not, is it a dark space, what we?re wearing.? This sixth sense for danger was highlighted in [another popular Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/JenAshleyWright/status/1046482840731492391?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1046482840731492391&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scoopwhoop.com%2Fwhat-men-and-women-do-to-avoid-sexual-harassment-twitter-thread%2F) late last year, when a social researcher informally polled men and women to share what they do on a daily basis to avoid being sexually assaulted; all men replied with variations of ?Nothing,? while women responded with hundreds of specific actions, small and large, that they take to keep themselves safe.

[**#MeToo Is Making People Confront Their Trauma. And Most Are Unequipped To Do So.**](https://theswaddle.com/metoo-india-mental-health-and-trauma/)



But Saeed hesitates to qualify this state as hypervigilance, a clinical term that describes a state of increased sensory alertness. Hypervigilance, Saeed says, is ?the body saying there is a threat in the environment, so, you have to be at your most alert self. You can?t be relaxed, because if you?re quiet or relaxed, then something bad can happen to you. The system is always sensing threat.? In fact, a hypervigilant person might perceive stressors as threatening when others simply view them as stressors. Hypervigilance is considered a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder and has been documented in soldiers and natural disaster victims. It is also associated with anxiety and other mood or personality disorders.



In women, ?conditioning already leads to vigilance,? she says. ?If you add an incident that leaves a traumatic impact? then hypervigilance is probable, though not inevitable. ?Different people process \[trauma\] differently,? she says, adding that a lack of coping mechanisms contributes to the development of hypervigilance after a traumatic experience. (She also notes hypervigilance isn?t always the effect of gendered trauma, and it can also affect men.)



?Trauma can take many forms,? she says. ?It can manifest in many forms, too.?



One of those forms could be vicarious, she says, that is, an emotional reaction to others? accounts of trauma that leaves a person anxious, angry and/or sad; in the midst of [India?s wave of #MeToo](https://theswaddle.com/tag/metoo/)reporting late last year, [many of those involved in the movement reported exhaustion, depression, distress,](https://theswaddle.com/metoo-india-mental-health-and-trauma/) panic attacks, hyper-stimulation and more, not necessarily from their own trauma (though in many cases, that, too) but from empathetic reactions to an onslaught of stories about abuse, harassment and rape.



These stories surround us; newspapers report brutal crimes against women almost every day. Even fiction provides no escape. In a [recent op-ed for The Guardian, Hallie Rubenhold spotlights](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/02/from-jack-the-ripper-to-ted-bundy-why-are-dead-womens-bodies-still-being-used-as-entertainment) ?our drive to use women?s brutalized bodies as a flimsy springboard to tell a story about a male killer.? She lists an overwhelming number of popular and upcoming shows that rely on abused, maimed and murdered women to frame the narrative ? Netflix?s *Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes*; Hollywood?s upcoming E*xtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile*, also about the serial killer; BBC One?s *Jack the Ripper ? The Case Reopened*. Prestige television is awash with it, she argues: *Luther*. *True Detective*. *The Killing*. *The Fall*. *Top of the Lake*. It would be remiss not to add to that list India?s latest prestige drama, [*Delhi Crime*](https://theswaddle.com/delhi-crime-tackles-rape-but-not-rape-culture/), based on the gruesome and barbaric rape and murder of 2012?s Nirbhaya case.



Even for women removed from these (largely) digital movements and entertainment, vicarious trauma is possible; according to the last National Family Health Survey (NHFS-4), [one in every three women in India experiences sexual or physical abuse at home](https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-elephant-in-the-room-every-third-woman-in-india-faces-domestic-violence-1654193.html), making it likely that most women know the true-life story of at least one woman who is the survivor of assault, if not more.



There are no reliable stats on hypervigilance in women, though it is well-known that anxiety disorders, which often accompany hypervigilance, [are twice as common in women than men](https://adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/women/facts). There are only stories like Chiu?s, which anecdotally every woman can identify with, but no one has quantified. Without figures, however, it?s difficult to gauge the fallout. Hypervigilance, as an ongoing state of fight-or-flight, takes a physical toll. ?There will be a lot of physiological reactions similar to chronic stress,? says Saeed. Digestion, sleep and endocrine function will be disrupted, she says. Chronic stress has also been linked to [increased risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attack, and impaired fertility and sexual desire](https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-body).



While the increased awareness of environmental threats most women describe may not always qualify clinically as hypervigilance, it?s difficult to rule out the possibility that this heightened alertness has similar effects. ?It?s a spectrum,? Saeed says. ?There?s no point at which you can say, ?This is relaxed, and this is hyperawareness.'?



?We have mental stories about what is likely to happen to us. And we?re not aware of these stories, and we?re not aware of our bodily reactions \[to them\],? she says. Dealing with heightened alertness means becoming more aware of what your body is going through. ?The bodily system has been wired to be alert; you can?t force it to shut down.



You have to rewire it to relax,? she says. Saeed advises in the moment of heightened response (not in moments of actual danger) grounding your feet and focusing on your breath. Over time, meditating can help if the feelings of increased awareness become overwhelming ? until, of course, society stops giving women a reason to be hyper alert.



?A certain degree of increased vigilance comes with \[gendered\] conditioning,? Saeed says. ?Conditioning has a big role to play in it.?

After thinking long and hard about everything I stand for and also reviewing some of the awful experiences I've had on sets. I was shooting a music video for my last job ever and I wasn't told who the artist would be. 



Turns out it was an insanely mysgonistic rapper and I would be dancing in the background.  Everyone was professional on set and besides the fact I worked hours that were way too long and wasn't paid (it was a ""trial""), however once off set things got ugly. I'm engaged and the rapper knew this but kept texting me and contacting me on instagram demanding we have a date night, asking when he can call me when I'm alone etc. After I politely declined and told him again I'm engaged he cut all my scenes in the video. I'd stayed later than any girl because he wanted me in main scenes with him and yet they have all been cut from the video. I never showed interest in this guy at all, no signs whatsoever yet because I declined sleeping with him he tries to sabotage my career.



Along with this the only shots they did use of me were super objectifying (a close up of under my boobs).



My first ever modeling shoot actually turned out to be a guy who was involved in a sex trafficking ring- he offered me drugs and alcohol and had a whole room set up to groom young vulnerable girls. I've had photograohers try to take me to hotels, try to push my limits and shoot me nude, and I've generally just felt unsafe and scared more times than I can count.

This is long, so bear with me. 





For a bit of background, an MSU student, Erik Powell was enrolled in a human sexuality class. He met with his professor to discuss his discomfort with a TiM in the class- Myka Perry- and requested that he not sit next to Perry, or interact with him. When the professor asked what Powell would do if Perry attempted to engage with him, Powell said that he would tell Perry to stop, and if he persisted Powell would ?break her face?. He allegedly made references to keeping loaded guns in his truck. The professor notified campus police of this threat, and Powell was suspended from campus, pending investigation. 





At this point the situation became a Title IX investigation. [The Title IX coordinator](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/msu-title-ix-director-steps-down-lawsuit-alleges-bias-against/article_84952c53-fada-543f-9301-28511c535b59.html), a woman who identified herself on social media as ?an aspiring ally? to LGBT people, sent a gushing email to the TiM student, thanking him for ?trusting? the Title IX office. She offered Perry assistance and guidance beyond the scope of the investigation. She also failed to report that Perry stated that he carries a knife with him on campus - which he showed her.



Powell was found guilty, and his case became a cause celebre among MRAs and the right wing and anyone else decrying discrimination against straight men on college campuses. 





Powell appealed, and a judge agreed with him. He recently won a settlement, and his expulsion was stricken from his record. He is attending another college. The Title IX coordinator, and at least one other faculty member involved in the case were reassigned.

Hello! 



I have been lurking on this subreddit for many months now, and finally decided to create a Reddit account and subscribe. I feel I have so much to say, most of which I cannot express in either Ex Muslim or liberal feminist places (and certainly not in my 'own' community i.e the South Asian/Muslim community). But this community seems like it is full of women who may actually *get* it, and finding radical feminism has been a revelation for me - so here goes. I hope this is the appropriate place to share some of my experiences, please let me know if it is not!  



**Part One: Being raised a girl in a patriarchal Muslim family (hint: nobody checked my 'gender identity' before deciding my place, worth or rights in life).**





I was raised in a traditional Sunni Muslim household.  Growing up as a girl and then a woman in this religion suffocated me every day. Whatever many Muslims and the so-called liberal left would like to say, my community were not 'extreme' in the sense that their interpretation of Islam was not some crazy, evil, radical interpretation, nor were they random evil people influenced only by their 'culture' as distinct from their religious beliefs. No, our family life was an entirely normal, traditional interpretation of Islam based on standard understandings of the main scriptures and teachings (Quran, Hadith & commentary). 



I went to mosque five times a week, where I was taught that my body should be covered to a much higher degree than my male siblings; that my inheritance and testimony was worth half that of a male's even though I shouldered the financial burden at home (being the only one with a decent job); that if I refused my husband sex, the angels would curse me all night; that my husband could marry four wives PLUS what was then taught to me as 'that which his right hand possesses', but what I now, frankly, call 'concubines' or 'sex slaves'; that my husband could 'beat' me if I disobeyed him, but that was OK because according to some scholars he could 'only' do it with a 'light tap' or that he could 'only' do it as a last resort after he had first tried to separate our beds, then not speaking to me, as though I was a child to be admonished into obedience - and on and on it goes. Please note that my intention is not to start any religious debates about the exact literal meaning of these verses, etc, but just to try to explain how demeaned I felt growing up as a young woman in Islam. 



I felt suffocated not only by the clothes I had been commanded by God to wear (as I believed at the time), but also by the entire ideology itself and what that said about my place in the world. 'Hijab' is not just a piece of fabric around one's hair - it separates you from your fellow males and teaches you that something about YOUR hair and body as opposed to theirs is inherently lustful, sinful, to be viewed only by the man you end up marrying (and some other close family members); it mandates that you do not show the shape of your body; it dictates that when you walk, you wear no 'noisy' jewellery or perfume so as not to attract male attention - it is just one part of an entire system of modesty which disproportionately burdens women. 



I tried so hard to really believe all of this was 'empowering' in some way, that it meant I had escaped the beauty standards and objectification of women in society - but how could I ever really believe that, when hijab is sexualised just as much as anything else by many men. I have been proposed to and hit on in the lewdest ways by men whilst dressed head to toe in black, with my hair covered. I never deep down believed this was an empowering system, I could never really grasp it. I tried to read the Quran to educate myself and find justification for what seemed like inherent unfairness to women, but everything I read just made me more and more disgusted. 



No wonder, then,  that I despised being a woman. I hated it. I did not want this life, I remember telling my father from a young age that I wish I had been born a boy, that I wanted *their* modesty obligations (basically just cover from the navel to the knees) and just enjoy basic freedoms like playing outside in the sunshine without worrying about exposing my elbows or a strand of hair (sidenote, when everything is covered, men will fetishize literally anything - elbows, strands of hair, a quick flash of ankle, that is all it takes. Hijab never made me feel protected). But I could not 'identify' my way out of my place in life. Nobody asked me what my gender identity was before they decided my rights in marriage, my inheritance rights, the modesty doctrine I was to follow. My entire self worth was decided the moment that I was born and my parents saw I had a vagina, rather than a penis. This was to dictate the rest of my life, and become even more of a burden once puberty hit and my breasts developed and I suddenly became a walking sin to be covered up.  This is why the idea that a man can just 'identify' into womanhood and then demand I do not 'centre' my feminism around my vagina/genitals/reproductive system is so offensive to me. My vagina and female body has been the reason for my oppression and second class status my whole life, I can no sooner de-centre it from my life than I can turn into a unicorn. 



**Part Two: Becoming an Ex Muslim and finding liberal feminism**



To cut a long story short, after years of struggling with my faith I eventually ended up leaving Islam and becoming an atheist. I could not tolerate it anymore. I did not want to get married to a man and sign up to a religious marriage which I felt was a deeply demeaning institution for women. 



After many years, I found some other ex Muslim women (and men) in a local community. But I felt out of step with many of them too, as the feminism in these communities (in my experience) tends to be a very liberal 'sex positive' kind of feminism - in a panel on feminism and Islam, one of the women called herself a sex positive feminist when asked about the sex trade. I was uncomfortable with this, but never found the language to express why I could not get on board if porn/prostitution was 'personal choice.' It felt strange to me that as Ex Muslim women, we were able to see the inherent problems with claiming the hijab is a free, empowering, feminist choice. Many Ex Muslim women spoke of how this sort of 'choice' feminist defence of the hijab was only really relevant for relatively few privileged Western women, whilst many of our sisters across the globe were forced into it. They acknowledged that even amongst ourselves in our very liberal world, we had often tried to convince ourselves we felt 'empowered' by or 'chose' the hijab when oftentimes the very idea that it was 'commanded by God' or expected by the community created a lot of pressure to wear it to be seen as 'pure' or 'worthy'. And yet these same women did not seem to apply the same kind of critique of 'choice' feminism to things like the sex trade, prostitution, etc. I would be curious to know if any other Ex Muslim/ex religious women felt like this? 



Also, in the Ex Muslim groups I saw very young, vulnerable women who had just been kicked out of their homes in polyamorous relationships with older men. Again, this made me uncomfortable - these men were also the same people helping  to support the woman in question financially and the women never seemed as happy about the polyamory as the men did. Maybe this is just my perception, but I have personally spoken to at least a few of the women who confessed they really wanted an exclusive relationship with the man in question. Also many women expressed feeling 'preyed upon' in private by some of the ex Muslim men who joined just to find women to sleep with. There was also a lot of pressure to sleep around and I was not into any of that. I got the feeling that having left a very restrictive religion, Ex Muslim men and women placed a very high value on personal freedom and choice, especially when it came to sexual partners, perhaps for entirely understandable reasons. But it did result in a sort of converse pressure to sleep around, be cool and free - I wanted to reject Islam but not then be pressured to sleep around to prove how free and liberal I was. 



Why does this matter? Because when I first moved out of my family's home many years ago, I was alone and had no family. I was lost, confused, penniless. After some months of this, I met a much older man and ended up for a while sleeping on his sofa - until he wanted more. I had my first sexual experiences with this man.  When the person you are sleeping with is the only thing keeping a roof over your head, choice became difficult, blurry. Luckily I realised very quickly that I was very, very uncomfortable and found the resources to do something about it, but not before I experienced sexual assault at a very vulnerable stage in my life. Nobody in the world should be pressured or forced - whether by force or financial circumstance to sell use of their bodies/sex. I still struggle to understand why my experience of Ex Muslim communities is that they do not often acknowledge this, and treat these decisions as empowering/liberal choices. 



I also struggle to understand why many are so quick to dismiss women who want female only spaces and have legitimate concerns about men in our spaces, particularly in rape centres, changing rooms etc. Given that so many of us were oppressed by men because of our female bodies, I would have expected more support. It has been heart breaking to find the opposite.  



**Part Three: Finding radical feminism and this sub**



I had been mulling over the above issues for many years, slowly feeling like I was going crazy. I was so incredibly glad when I found this sub reddit! Thank you all so much, I have never commented before but really found a lot of strength with the unapologetic women-centred support I see in this subreddit. When people call this place hateful, I wonder if they ever think of all the people you lift up and strengthen. I know many Ex Muslim women feel betrayed by liberal feminism, but so far radical feminists have unapologetically refused to sell us out for fear of criticising Islam. 



It was a great older teacher and mentor of mine who introduced me to radical feminism. She is an amazing retired lesbian rad fem who has really supported me over the years. She challenged my thinking when I was Muslim and never stopped criticising the hijab, religious marriage, etc. I owe so much of my life and freedom to her - so I would like to say to all you older radfem women, we younger women need you. Thank you to each and every one of you!

Afterwards, the manbabies wouldn?t stop complaining about how they almost got expelled (AS IF..) and lambasted her for being ?so sensitive it was a joke jeeez wimmin!1!!? This guy was my friend at the time so when I asked the friend group why they thought her reporting him for such aggressions behaviour is wrong, they were outraged and claimed she could?ve ?ruined his life and education? the way society talks about men on trial for rape which is ridiculous.

For several years my boyfriend was emotionally abusive. He never hit me, but he used his anger and threats of violence to keep me in line. He tried to control what I did for a living, what I wore, and even what time I came home. He didn't want me to drive, and his criticisms of my driving almost got us into more than one car accident (but not as many near-accidents as his own driving. He tended to drive recklessly, especially when angry). He treated me like a child and had complete control of our finances, he chided me in public and shamed me for minor things in front of strangers, and when I tried to stand up for myself, he acted just like a TRA and whimpered and whined, telling me how much I'd hurt him. 



His abuse also crossed the line into sexual abuse, also like a TRA. He'd spend the day either criticizing me or neglecting/ignoring me, only to turn around and expect sex. He would pester and pester and pester, often wearing me down. Afterward I would always feel nauseated and dirty, but also somehow guilty for not wanting to in the first place. 



I put up with this for a long, long time, and the last straw was when he started having an affair. He flaunted it in my face, and to be honest, I came close to ending it all several times before I finally let her have him, packed my bags, and left town. For all I know they're still together, but for her sake I hope not. 



I've been away from him for several years now, but I don't feel like I've healed because I haven't really processed the abuse. I've told hardly anyone about the abuse. Not our mutual friends from my former community, not (many of) my new friends, and not my family. Part of this is because I'm sure that, as a woman, either nobody will believe me, or everyone will think it was my fault, especially the cheating. Because obviously, so much sarcasm, it's not that he was a predator, it's that I worked too much or gained too much weight or had too many thoughts or something of the sort. 



Another part of it, a part I'm ashamed of, is that I'm protecting the little bastard. Part of this is female socialization, but part of it is that he ""rescued"" me from a situation that was even worse, and where there was actual physical abuse. I can't stop thinking that I would never have been strong enough to get away from the previous bastard on my own, so I feel like I owe him. It's sick and it's awful and I wish I could get that thought out of my head, but the idea of myself as a sad, useless, pathetic little damsel is etched into my brain, even as I continue to evolve and become more independent. 



That's the venting part, and how here's the question part. How the hell do I stop being grateful to him and start being angry? How do I move past female socialization and stop blaming myself for not being good enough, pretty enough, skinny enough, stupid enough, sexually receptive enough (the other woman was conventionally pretty and docile)? Are there any books or articles out there on emotional abuse that are written by radical feminists, and unlikely to contain victim-blaming and tripe about forgiving? I'm also a firm believer in therapy, but I'm reluctant because I know so many women who've suffered through libfem therapists. I don't want to be set back even more because some horse's ass wants me to look for my ""part"" in the situation or treats me as ""codependent,"" which is a term relating to drug and alcohol addiction and not relationships... but somehow, nobody seems to understand this? 



Radical feminist perspectives on abuse desperately needed, especially if anyone has a mental health background or has been through something similar. Thanks, sisters, for giving me a place to talk about this. You're some of the first people I've come out to.

Recently, I've been seeing increased posts about the uptake of toxic and misguidedly 'feminist' ideas being used to target and harm trans people. I've also seen trans folks in this sub and others internalize and/or identify with some of these beliefs.



As somebody who self-harmed by visiting subs dedicated to manufacturing and spreading this rhetoric, I just want to ask all of my trans siblings to go easy on yourselves, to know that you are loved by your trans family, and to know that your trans identity is not something to be ashamed of. I'm writing this message from a throwaway account, because in the past, I was targeted by these so called 'feminists' with doxxing and other threats for writing these kinds of messages. I just don't want to deal with that anymore, but I do think this message needs to be repeated every so often.



Here are some important ideas that I hope you will remember and reflect on to overcome internalized transphobia and other forms of self-loathing:



* Gender dysphoria is a real issue. For those who struggle with this very human and real condition, you didn't 'choose' to experience gender dysphoria. You are doing the best that you can to overcome something that you do not have control over. There is a huge body of evidence to suggest that attempting to 'repair' or 'transform' feelings of gender dysphoria (and gender identity) through talk therapy are ineffective and deleterious, so I'm not going to cite everything that comes to mind. But here's a very accessible synthesis of some of this literature: [https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/355235](https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/355235)

* You were not 100% socialized as your assigned sex. If any of you who hold this belief, please think about this carefully. Socialization includes both the normative conditioning that is imposed on you based on your assigned sex, **AND** your internalization/response to this conditioning (some of it conscious, some of it not). As a trans woman who was closeted and dysphoric since my very early memories, I can definitely say that although I was expected to perform masculinity in certain ways, and probably did reap some 'gendered' benefits from my upbringing, I was in so much distress through my childhood that I did not reap the same benefits as, for instance, my cis brother. I'm sure many of you have similar stories. I'm not saying we should ignore our pre-transition histories, especially if we're open to talking about them, but we do not have the same exact 'filters' that we apply to messages we receive in our socialization as cis folks of our assigned sex. Please read the Whipping Girl by Julia Serano and play close attention to her account of socialization. For AFAB folks, check out Leslie Feinberg's work - they are an exceptional and amazing writer. I'm sure you'll see at least small parts of your story reflected in these texts.

* There is no such as a universal ""AFAB socialization experience"" and a universal ""AMAB socialization experience."" Assigned sex is just one dimension of bio/social location that helps explain how our childhood comes together to affect our adult experiences. Factors like race, class, our performance of gender non-conformity (including perceived non-heterosexuality), mental health, along with (dis)ability, all come together to determine how we experience socialization and how that socialization impacts our adult lives. The socialization of a South Asian trans woman, who was raised for much of her childhood in a very LGBTQ-hostile country while actively dysphoric and attracted to men, reflects disadvantage in a way that is totally absent from from the experience of a cis straight white woman who is raised in North America. The socialization of a poor cis gay black man in the US reflects disadvantage in ways that are very distinct and important to recognize, relative to the upbringing of a straight cis white woman in the US whose family is upper middle class. I apologize if this is overly simplistic to people who are familiar with intersectionality, but bear in mind that there people who are not and need to be reminded of this.

* Transphobes who hide behind 'feminism' like to misuse the infamous Swedish study to indicate that trans women have 'male-pattern criminality,' and that this somehow is 'proof' that we are really just men. They ignore that FTM men in that sample also reported 'male-pattern criminality,' and that 'male-pattern criminality' is just a bogus concept when we realize that many marginalized groups of people engage in violent crime at rates that are higher than those reported in 'genpop' samples of women. There is plenty of literature to suggest that lesbian and gay couples, for example, report higher rates of domestic violence than heterosexual couples (even when we disaggregate by sex and gender) and young lesbian women have rates of 'criminality' that far exceed those of same-age straight women. See, for example: ([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kateryna\_Sylaska/publication/275220195\_Intimate\_Partner\_Violence\_Among\_Sexual\_Minority\_Populations\_A\_Critical\_Review\_of\_the\_Literature\_and\_Agenda\_for\_Future\_Research/links/558dba8b08ae47a3490bd5e8.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kateryna_Sylaska/publication/275220195_Intimate_Partner_Violence_Among_Sexual_Minority_Populations_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Literature_and_Agenda_for_Future_Research/links/558dba8b08ae47a3490bd5e8.pdf)) and ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10467488](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10467488)). This is not because lesbians and gay men are all somehow 'socialized as violent males' - it is because there are unique circumstances that underly those numbers, including factors like minority stress (i.e., homophobia), poverty, mental health issues, substance use, etc - issues that are common across marginalized groups. The lower crime rates of 'Genpop women' have been explained by theories of socialization that apply specifically to cis straight white women in North America and Europe. A great reading on this topic is ""The LGBT Offender"" in this book: [https://books.scholarsportal.info/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks3/springer/2014-04-01/1/9781461491880](https://books.scholarsportal.info/en/read?id=/ebooks/ebooks3/springer/2014-04-01/1/9781461491880) , which also summarizes some of the statistical differences in criminality between heterosexual and sexual minority women.

* Yes, cis women do sometimes harm trans people (including trans women) with physical and sexual violence. In fact, in data collected by FORGE in 2004, 30% of trans respondents reported being sexually assaulted at least once by a female perpetrator (the researchers include a separate category for ""transgender perpetrators,"" before people start wondering if that just means MTF on MTF violence): [http://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/partners-guide.pdf](http://forge-forward.org/wp-content/docs/partners-guide.pdf)

* I, as a trans woman, am not personally responsible for the violent behaviours of some trans people, in the same that I am not personally responsible for the violent behaviours of some people who are my race (hint: I'm not a white person, and my race is frequently targeted with suspicions of being inherently violent). If a trans person did a terrible thing, I'm sorry this happened and I will always condemn the act. However, I will not take it a step further to claim that that act represents who trans people are as a whole. I will also continue standing in solidarity with other trans people (who are still much more likely to experience violence than perpetrate it, and are still underrecognized as a category of victimized people). If you don't engage in violence, I hope we get to stand together in this way.

* Trans people are not responsible for the erosion of women's services. The patriarchy, and sexism/misogyny as systems driven by this structure, are responsible for eroding women's services. If there is violence in the context of women's spaces, it's often because said women's space is poorly resourced and underfunded (yes, this includes spaces intended for trans women specifically, not just ones that exclude trans women), and therefore lacks the capacity to provide the range of services needed to help women recover following exposure to trauma. Violence has historically occurred in women's spaces back when they were exclusively intended for AFAB people, and it continues in trans-inclusive women's spaces now, likely for the same reasons. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of literature on women's experiences in women's spaces because, well, women's issues tended to be ignored in research. Here is a qualitative study from 1999 though, indicating that this has and unfortunately will remain a possibility by virtue of the system I'm describing here: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leslie\_Tutty/publication/229085616\_Residents%27\_Views\_of\_the\_Efficacy\_of\_Shelter\_Services\_for\_Assaulted\_Women/links/00b7d52000da702647000000/Residents-Views-of-the-Efficacy-of-Shelter-Services-for-Assaulted-Women.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leslie_Tutty/publication/229085616_Residents%27_Views_of_the_Efficacy_of_Shelter_Services_for_Assaulted_Women/links/00b7d52000da702647000000/Residents-Views-of-the-Efficacy-of-Shelter-Services-for-Assaulted-Women.pdf).

Jenn Smith in one of his videos said that the TRA movement courted the media through what he called ""cooing doves."" Beautiful, socially charming, well put together TIMs would go on Phil Donahue and be perfectly lovely. Looking at old talk shows from the late 70s and early 80s, I see what he means. The TIMs did, on television, ""pass."" But there were some particular reasons for it that I don't think the average ""cooing dove"" could achieve today.



First, television was only in standard def. On the average small screen this would cover a lot. No one had ever heard of transition via hormones and surgery before, so I could see how people might think that an HSTS was a rather odd looking but still beautiful woman. I'm guessing there was more gate keeping back then and doctors were more honest about not taking on cases where they knew damn well they couldn't make a near passing patient.



When it was just a few trans people visible, they probably did pass, but when there were more and more TIMs, HSTS or not, the patterns became more apparent. The center of gravity. Buttocks that were just a little oddly shaped. Chins that were just a little too strong. Shoulders that no diet could wear away.



Once the selfie became a thing, the cat was out of the bag. Now everyone knew how makeup, lighting, filters and photo shop worked. It went from being a slightly unusual looking woman to a garden variety appearance that would only pass in highly controlled and brief circumstances. The HSTS men pass less than they did 40 odd years ago. So the whole ""How do you even know a woman is trans?!"" is based off of a bygone era when almost no one knew about transsexuality.



Now that transgenderism is well known in Western societies, ""stealth"" is getting harder and ""clocking"" is unavoidable. 



I am 38 and am frequently mistaken for about 20, but plenty of things would give me away if I sat down at a table with 20 year old women. Even the overweight ones. Even the tan addict ones who already have wrinkles. Even the one with the dancer's bunions. If I can't fully pass as an age I actually did experience, you can never pass as what you never were. A 70 year old man watching the whole table would figure out that I am most likely his daughter's age, not his granddaughter's. People might be sort of fooled because most have never encountered a 38 year old woman trying to convince everyone she's trans generational. They'd still see that something is wrong, even if they can't name it. But if trans generational became a thing, it would be obvious every time.



That's why I think plastic surgeons should tell TIMs that stealth should never be the goal, since it will not be met. I think they should tell TIFs, that, too, since patterns are emerging in that movement as well.

I remember studying Concept Theory in my cognitive sciences courses in college and it was fascinating.  There are a lot of theories on how humans categorize certain concepts.  Cognitive scientists discuss at length how humans know a table is a table? what is its ?tableness? that distinguishes it from, let?s say, a chair.  Some argue prototype theory; some argue exemplar theory; some argue that your brain has nodes that light up when you see a table and different amounts of nodes lighting up mean different levels of tableyness.  But they all agree that humans have the ability recognize and categorize tables as tables and chairs as chairs, and that both tables and chairs exist.  Somewhat like ?obscenity?, you know it when you see it, and the questions the cognitive scientists are trying to answer is ?why? and ?how.?

Nothing could make it more clear that Queer/PoMo advocates are diametrically opposed to the aims of feminism. Feminism is a movement centered upon female liberation, with the understanding that male violence is a global endemic. Males are responsible for: 99% of rapes, 96% of homicides, 83% of arson, 78% of violent assault. The only reason we know those numbers is because sex is acknowledged at birth. **By advocating for the end of recording sex, they are advocating for any method by which we can know, understand, and respond to male violence/female subjugation.**



But that's just the tip of the iceberg on the implications of this. Millions of females are missing from the global population due to sex selective infanticide and abortion. Women receive substandard healthcare because most medical studies are conducted on the male body. If the genderists/MRA dream comes to pass, **every sex-based statistic we know would be gone within a single generation.**

Jobs not at risk are typically in the field of child care and personal support. I greatly encourage readers to check page 17 of the actual report to see the full breakdown and other statistics, and to compare and contrast with the chart just below it showing majority male jobs.



This movement is being compared heavily to the automation and outsourcing of previously majority-female textile jobs which, while being in awful conditions, nonetheless offered itself to greater female autonomy.



Furthermore, it's worth noting that low-skill male jobs like driving and construction are at-risk as well, but nonetheless either delayed (as I mentioned earlier, courtesy of legislation) or offset (most construction work is mid-skill rather than low-skill). Those highest paying jobs (and many would argue, highest-skill) overall like executive and software work still have a high tendency to be male and least likely to be automated away. 



Those mid-skill jobs like supervisors are much less likely to be automated and have a decent chunk of women in them already, however it's worth noting that more than anything this sudden freeing of labor is going to force displaced workers to compete with high-skilled workers with years of experience on them and of course, increase the labor supply in those fields which will naturally drive wages and benefits down.

I'm sure everyone is familiar with Philip Bunce but for those who don't know - Philip Bunce is a senior director at Credit Suisse who was awarded a place on a list of the Top 100 women in business.

When I read this story I couldn't believe the ridiculousness of it - how can a cross-dressing man take up space on this list instead of a woman?

Surely trans people would agree with this also..?



Then I started thinking about how Caitlyn Jenner was named woman of the year a few years back, and how some feminists had a problem with it / still do. I would never say it out loud for fear of sounding transphobic, but I can't shake the feeling that there's something not quite right about a person who has lived nearly all of their adult life as a man, transitions then gets awarded woman of the year. Especially given the problematic person she is.



Similarly, when Munroe Bergdorf was hired as a key-note speaker for the BFI's Women With a Movie Camera summit there was an inevitable backlash from radical feminists who felt the opportunity was taken away from a woman with more experience.

Some of my peak trans moments that have led me here... in a mom's group, one of the ""nonbinary"" members seems to have brainwashed everyone, as we can no longer say ""ladies"" or ""women"" when addressing the group. She's a midwife who uses they/them pronouns and calls other midwives ""transphobic"" if they refer to women's health, birthing moms (instead of birthing parents), breastfeeding (instead of chestfeeding or lactating), motherhood (instead of parenthood) or anything else that isn't 100% gender-neutral. This is a midwife, and this is the tone she has set in a mom's group for cryin out loud.

In this same mom's group, there was a woman who said she was being aggressively pursued by a trans man. ""He"" sounded like a total narcissist, and was demanding that this woman date ""him"". She had no interest in dating this person and ""he"" was getting abusively forceful in my opinion. She asked the mom's group about how to handle this situation, and she was resoundingly told that she's transphobic for not dating ""him"" and that not all men have penises, and to exclusively date men who do have penises makes you transphobic. The pushy and aggressive behavior was totally glossed over in the attack on this poor woman for not wanting to get in bed with this person. What. In. The. Everloving... So you're going to call yourselves a bunch of feminists, while telling someone that they should be having a sexual experience with someone who makes them uncomfortable?

Okay so I am super pissed with another forum, trying to sell the ""sex work is work"" crap. They are claiming that it in theory could be, if we just changed our attitudes and legalized it. AND they said that I was morally obligated to prove my bigoted claims, otherwise I was the granny of all bigots from Bigotland. I sent them links from several sources showing that legalization of prostitution increases trafficking. ""Well, that just means fine tuning is in order."" Then I get the whole ""feminists conflate ordinary Playboy with hardcore violent porn."" I sent some links about Hugh Hefner's actual thoughts on women, and explained that even if there are different levels of porn, there are still problems at every level. Back to sex work. ""There are tons of shitty jobs out there. Why are we singling sex work out?""



I try explaining that sure, there are shitty jobs out there. But prostitution depends on human trafficking, violence, slavery, underage girls, disabled women (oh yes) and sometimes outright murder to survive as a business. Even with legalization. Even if even if even if. If you're going to tell me it's just a matter of fine tuning then I'm going to say YOU are morally obligated to tell me what magic little regulation will fix everything. 



Some asshole thought he was being crafty by telling me about nail salons that also trafficked their workers. I pointed out that since those salons are indeed legal and regulated, that's strong evidence to say that it doesn't work for prostitution where customers want to be anonymous and KNOW the prostitutes are underage, exploited, and don't want to be there. When nail salons were exposed, several states in the Northeast did a fast and furious sweep, shutting many of them down in under a month. (This also shows that it's really not hard to shut down a trafficking ring. You just need to get out of your swivel chair and do it). Amazingly, the ""massage parlors"" were left untouched. Male politicians got to look like white knights while still protecting their favorite brothels. 



The truth is, women really don't want to be in prostitution. Naive young women in their gap year don't stay in it for long once they see that it's not what Diablo Cody said it would be. If men want this unicorn of a woman who truly enjoys prostitution, and meets their standards of fuckability, she'd be so rare and so expensive that only billionaires could afford to have tea with her.

I?ve found myself growing so disillusioned with liberal feminism in the past 3 years, it started when I decided to finally come out about being sex trafficked and abused by my ex boyfriend when I was 15-16, ?intersectionality? told me that I would be believed (or at least listened to). After I told a couple people I was closest to in real life, I decided to try to bring awareness to the very fucking real epidemic that is sex trafficking. I wasn?t a ?sex worker?, I wasn?t ?empowered?, i was a vulnerable teenager who was being beaten and raped. 



I wanted to be anonymous about it to protect myself and my image (because while I thought it was important, I was still afraid that coming out about rape is not the hug/cry/love fest we?re told it is) so I tried posting about it on twox, I was called a SWERF. I didn?t even know what the fuck that meant. I was victim blamed for not telling the police about the rape when my parents made me take him to court for a restraining order (i only got a no contact order and he stalked me until I moved out of the state almost 3 years later lol). 



After that I started seeing the glaring cracks in their ideology; lesbians being shamed for not wanting to sleep with someone who has a dick, ?sex positivity? being burdened by a rhetoric that pushes the liability upon violated women to ?liberate? ourselves as if we?re prisoners of our own minds and nothing else, forcing us to adapt to mens desires even if it HURTS because well golly, saying no to a specific sex act must mean you?re not a Cool Girl! In my relationships with men I was told to just accept their pornography addictions and disgusting fucking fetishes, because that?s all fine and good! Doesn?t matter if it hurts me because it?s something that brings men pleasure! If I say it makes me deeply uncomfortable that must mean i?m an insecure, controlling hag! Not wanting to engage in polyamory means I?m stifling my partners ?natural sexual urges?, I?m sorry but for me, personally, I?m okay with monogamy. Because I?m bisexual that automatically mean I?d date a trans person? No? Well I guess I must be an evil bigot who?s not deserving of love.  Telling women that we NEED to be standing up and saying ?no? to behavior that harms us while shaming us for having the gall to do so when it doesn?t fit a certain worldview.

Not only is there the ?costume? aspect - but they also change their behavior when performing in drag. A lot of it is talking like a ?ditz?, playing stupid, acting promiscuous, unrealistic high pitched voice, and exaggerated mannerisms that are ?feminine.? They?re essentially dressing up as misogynistic stereotypes of how they view femininity - especially when you compare it to the drag that women (rarely) do as men.

Sorry if this is too personal, but I've been reading the subreddit with my real account, and this recent trauma just resurfaced and I'm feeling sick.



I met a guy during christmas holidays and we clicked really well. He was quite feminine (in a stereotipical way I guess, I like ""non-traditionally-masculine"" men) so he was sweet, caring, and whatnot. Also ""a feminist"". Perfect.



Red flag I ignored at the time:

-Someone jokingly mentioned BDSM in a conversation, and he told me privately sth like ""Oh yeah my ex liked that lol. So weird.""



-Sometime later he proceeded to admit they were actually both into it. (Ok???) I made it clear that I had no intention of doing that EVER.



Now first time sex: he was more aggresive than I was used to... I fell a little bit used almost, but ok... I could handle it... **Then suddenly he chokes me**. Not with murdery strength, but just his hands being in that action sent me into a freaking crisis. Luckily I was able to stop him right there. He immediately went back to his sweet persona and apologized... What kind of person does that?!?!



Sadly, he's still bugging me, and even though I'm still attracted to him (we got along great as friends at first) I haven't been able to get him off me... (and I'm ashamed to say I agreed to sex a couple of times after that) so I'm gathering the courage to face him. I'm sick to my stomach and scared. Please send me strength :( and be aware of red flags like this!

I am a sixteen year old male who was drawn into reddit's trans-community after I found out I was attracted to other men. For almost an six months I questioned whether or not I was transgender with the support of reddit's trans' subs and people I met on those subs. I now believe these subreddits are dangerous. 



I was depressed and isolated and the community drew me in by offering what seemed to be a solution to all of the problems that had been plaguing me. Anytime I questioned whether I was making the right decision, an army of users would tell me that being trans was the right way to deal with my issues. The community is cult-like. It is too easy for a depressed and directionless teenager to be drawn into these communities. The subreddits themselves are a breeding ground for pedophillic relationships, something I, myself, experienced. Older trans identifying males* are more than happy to ""advise"" younger people struggling with what is clearly not gender dysphoria, but mental illness. This seemingly innocent relationship, for me, quickly turned into an exploitative pedophillic one.  



If you are interested in more of my story, my previous post from about four months ago details the abuse and exploitation that I dealt with within the community. 



The reason I wanted to make this post here is because I want to tell you all that despite what the trans-community, insane progressives, or anybody says about radical feminism and this subreddit?it fucking saves lives. This subreddit is important. It is the most important tool in helping people like me escape from dangerous communities which attempt to push people like me to dangerous life altering decisions. I was scared to come here and start learning about the perspective presented here because of all the propaganda against it throughout leftist/trans reddit, but it served to validate the feelings I had upon learning that transition is a fraud for most people, and certainly wasn't for me. This sub has helped me reaffirm my identity as a feminine male, because I am NOT a women and I will NEVER be one.

859,2859,"Hey, ladies. So I'm in a bit of a situation. So I have this roommate, a male, who I used to be friends with. We've been roommates for ten months. When he moved into the city, he found a place that he couldn't afford without help and asked me to move in with him. I told him I couldn't afford half the rent. He said don't worry about it. He just needed a roommate and I'd take the smaller room. I shouldn't have trusted him when he said this was true. I should have known better, but we were pretty good friends at this point. Anyway, I move in with him and it becomes clear that he expects me to do all the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc for the apartment. He gets pee all over the bathroom floor and won't even clean it up. He leaves trash everywhere for me to pick up. I have to hound him for the money for bills. It's like we're stuck in a bad marriage but he's a gay man and I'm a lesbian. I've tried to talk to him about this several times and he just says he works too much (he's a pharmacy resident) and he doens't have time. I work full time and I'm a fulll time phd candidate. I dont' have the goddamn time to pick up after him either. I'm not his mother and if he treats his mom this way, he owes her an apology. Anyway he comes up to me last week, tells me he's been fired (this tends to happen when you don't meet a single deadline all year, are an asshole to all your female colleagues whom he calls ""bitches"", and you're half an hour late every day for ten months). He says he's moving out early and breaking the lease but he'll cover his portion of the rent until the lease is up.

That all changed tonight. He tells me he can't make rent. I finally lose it at him and call him out for being a sexist asshole who expects me to be his mother. He gets right up in my face, calls me a manipulative cunt who's been taking advantage of him this whole year because I spent too much on amazon which is money I could be giving him for rent, and when I tell him to not worry about the rent and just move out for may 1 and I'll figure the rest out, he looks at me in a way that I've never seen before, calls me a bitch, and tells me to go fuck myself. I've never seen anyone look at me like that before. It was pure contemptuous rage and hatred. I thought he was going to spit on me. He was right up in my face and he is a LOT bigger than me and I know he's unstable (currently uncontrolled BPD). I can't get that look out of my head. I'm not sitting on the front porch without shoes or a jacket because I'm too anxious to go back inside. What do I DO? How am I supposed to live with him for another three or four weeks?

This is not what bothers me. What bothers me is that he's going on and on, posting in MRA subs insisting this is a ""gendered"" issue and that he is being discriminated against as a male. He seems convinced that a woman would have had this dealt with years ago when it happened. He is also shocked at the level of backlash he has gotten for coming out about it and is angrily posting on the MRA subs about it.

So...I just don't get it. This is not a ""gendered"" issue. I'm a victim of rape, female, my attacker was male and I was so horribly harassed and defamed for coming out about it that I can no longer have non-anonymous social media accounts for my own safety and mental health. 



My rape also happened 3 years ago, I told two people about it and even that caused enough of a shit-storm that I was bullied behind my back and had people of the rapist's friend group come into my place of work and attempt to soil my name to my coworkers when I was not on shift. Thankfully, my coworkers stood up for me and told me what happened.



When I officially named the rapist, he threatened to sue me for defamation. Similar to what this dude is saying happened to him, retaliative charges. 



My university also knew about the entire situation as it was unfolding. They told me to get off of social media to avoid harassment but the only option they gave me for charges was to perform a ""he said, she said"" type of testimony, compare the events, and then have two student volunteers decide who they believed. I opted out of that because it sounded risky due to very little evidence that I had and time elapsed since the event. So, no charges were ever pressed. I also do understand that it would be wrong to convict him of something based on just my testimony. That's not a precedent that should be set.



He never ended up suing me but he's gone about his life pretty much unaffected. I get to walk around knowing people hate me for calling their friend a rapist. Since it was made public, I have no idea who knows and who doesn't, so when people talk to me, I just have to guess whether or not they're being fake-nice to me or will try to backstab me like so many others. I've also had local news stations contact me repeatedly asking invasive questions, when I told them I didn't want to participate in their article and would appreciate it if they weren't written at all, I was told the article would be written no matter what but it'd be better for me if I participated, otherwise they'd just publish his side.



I also used to be under the illusion that victims of rape get compassion, part of the reason I came out about it was because I wasn't sure that the young men and women talking shit actually knew why the rapist hated me, or whether or not they knew about the rape. I thought people *didn't* know and were trashing me because of something false the rapist said. 



That was not the case, they knew the entire time about the rape and *that* was why they hated me. So, there was no compassion from men *or* women locally.

On a related note, I keep seeing studies of women's opinions where men (TIMs) were also answering as 'women'. This is wrong for a number of reasons.

They always make it seem like it is some big mystery as to why Japanese people are having less sex and the birth rate is falling. They ignore how common prostitution is (in various forms, PIV isn?t legal but still common as well) and enjoukousai (sugar/compensated dating). Japanese men often still consider themselves a virgin if they have only had paid sex which is never distinguished in articles. 



There?s also the issue of porn. In Japanese porn women say ????? which means ?it hurts? while the man very roughly fingers her. From experience, this fingering is very painful and saying so only makes the man think you want it more. No attention is given to the woman in porn and this is reflected in IRL too. It?s a clich? that Japanese women give up on sex after marriage and I don?t really blame them if it?s true. 



Some articles will point to long Japanese working hours, which while partly true, ignore that the late hours are often due to having to go out drinking with workmates and then to a sex shop together.

This comment said that all people who suffer dysphoria are *by definition* ?trans? and that the *only* treatment for it is transition.  That anyone who *doesn?t* transition is ?repressing? who they are.  They took offense to someone else saying that some women  ?cope? with their own ?dysphoria? by becoming ?T*RFs.? Leaving aside whether that other person was correct or not, I want to focus on the response.  



How fucking arrogant and closed-minded do you have to be to think that *only trans people* ever feel anything like this ineffable dysphoria that they never shut up about? And that there is literally only one treatment which can make its sufferers feel any better, and that is to ?transition? your life away from the sex that you were born.  They really do think that Cis people are just floating happy and carefree in their perfect bodies and their perfect minds and no one ever suffers anything close to the  *pain of being dysphoric.* Like a woman has never looked at her bigger than average feet and thought that they felt like ?male? feet and that she hated them. Or the size of her arms, and hearing people whisper that she looked like a linebacker, and she cried herself to sleep that night and many others.  That they didn?t lay awake in their bodies wishing they could wake up in a *more* ?female?, dainty, beautiful, slender, *perfect* body than the terrible one that they were cursed with. No? that never happens.  



No one is else ever suffers from the idealization of certain gender characteristics that they don?t exhibit.  And if they do, that *means* they are trans!! So that little girl who feels like her body is betraying her because it?s not ?feminine? enough? she should *transition*! Or else she?s ?repressing? who she really is! But who, pray tell, should she ?transition? to? The more ?feminine? person she dreams she could be? Should we encourage this 12 yo to get liposuction and breast implants and figure out surgery to make shoulders less broad so she doesn?t have to feel this dysphoria? We couldn?t treat the underlying insecurities and try to help her learn to love the body she has; that would be conversion therapy. What if female puberty doesn?t make it better? Maybe we should encourage her to repress her natural hormones and take synthetic ones, so she can control exactly how her body develops and stop anything she doesn?t like from occurring, even if it makes her sterile? because her 12 yo self should definitely be in control of that. 



Watch them say I?m exaggerating or lying or building a strawman.  How can my life be a strawman? I used to lie in bed crying because I wasn?t *enough* of a girl? because I hated the parts of myself that I saw as ?too masculine.?  Are they going to say that wasn?t dysphoria that they go on and in about? How would they want that treated if anything that isn?t affirming is verboten? I was born female and am female and was a girl and am a woman.  I learned to accept the parts of myself that I hated as a child (or am at least trying)? because they are a part of me. Now I?m not saying that will work on every single person; but who the fuck are they to say that it can?t work on any of them.  



Who the fuck are they to gatekeep (oooo I said it!) what ?cis? people experience? Why do they think that they are the only ones who suffer from gender-related expectations!

That we want little boys who feel ?feminine? to be whoever they are, supported in their ?gender nonconformity,? supported that those recreational and sartorial choices ARE for them, are for boys? rejecting the social constraints on them that tell them they can?t wear whatever they want and play with whatever they want and be close to whomever they want and love whomever they want!  That true masculinity isn?t fragile and doesn?t have to be toxic.  That they are in a position to help change how the world treats both men and women and to be as cognizant of the differences in how they are treated and how they treat other men and boys and how they treat women and girls. 



That we want little girls who feel ?masculine? to feel supported that however they feel and however they look? that IS feminine because they are female; that the ?ideal? is a repressive social construct created to keep them from feeling happy and confident in themselves as they are. That they are free to wear what they want to wear and do what they want to do and be who they want to be, and love who they want to love and all of that, no matter how it presents, is feminine because they are women.  



And that they don?t need to become anyone else to be whoever they are.  That everyone is gender-non-conforming and ?non-binary?? because gender is a social construct designed to keep people fixed into the patriarchal constraints that have worked well to keep the male hegemony? and accepting all the facets of yourself doesn?t require denying your sex. And for the (very) few who still suffer that they are in the wrong body, we would *support* them pursuing other avenues of treatment to help them alleviate their pain, without giving them false hope that they can deny away the reality of their bodies and their sex, but that they can relieve some of the dysphoria that they feel.

Over the years he has changed the rules regarding access to accommodate requests.  If memory serves me, it started out as being only for women and was later expanded to women and their male guests.  At some point a security system was installed and codes would be issued only to women.  So of course the codes were shared and the rule became mostly unenforceable.  I stopped going when it became clear men were not going to be kept out despite the rules and requests.  Fast forward to 2019.  The rule in place was no men after 9pm.  It wasn't being respected, some dudes may have gotten kicked out (uncertain about this).  The rule was posted at the entrance along with the dictionary definition of woman.  The signs (on private property!) have been torn down and the entrance has been vandalized.  This freely shared community space that has been used mostly by women as an urban zen retreat since at least the early/mid 90s is now closed.

A lot of really good qualitative interviews on how TIM inmates perceive and perform gender. Well I was *floored* to learn that, at least in CA, despite the enormous rates of sexual assault (58.5%) and ""sexual misconduct"" (69.4%) they experience, the overwhelming majority of trans-identified males (64.9%) prefer to stay in men's prisons over women's (35.1%). According to them, the desire for the validation and sex that men provide them (and the desire to avoid actual women) explicitly outweighs their desire to stay safe!



I literally cannot fathom *preferring* such an extreme likelihood of being raped just because you want the chance to bag a man and girls are ""too much drama!"" My jaw is on the floor. I feel so angry that ANYONE would call someone like this a woman, would suggest that our experiences have ANYTHING in common. These people feel more unlike me than even men do!



Also worth noting: this researcher [didn't find any statistically significant difference](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/similar-assault-rates-regardless-of-housing-1.png) in rates of sexual assault between those in men's prisons and those in transgender-only units. In other words they rape each other almost as much as the men do. In fact the [only predictive risk factor](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/predictive-factors-sexual-assault-prison-1.png) they could find for sexual assault were having had a sexual or ""marriage-like"" relationship with a man. As always, dating men is one of the biggest risk factors for sexual assault.



It's become verboten to talk about the possibility that trans-identified males really are as predatory as any other male, but I feel like this really demonstrates the lengths to which a *large* percentage of them are willing to go in order to achieve sexual gratification and validation about their gender identity. Looking at this shocking data, how could anyone doubt that a similarly huge percentage of TIMs trying to transfer into women's prisons are trying to do so in order to gain sexual access to women?

* ""It's easier. Women are more complicated. They like to fight and prove themselves. Too much drama.""

* ""It'd be too much with too many women?too much drama/gossip.""

* ""When girls get together, there is too much bickering?too much drama.""

* ""\[Women\] are viscous. They are worse than men. Their hormones are going all the time. Imagine being around 60 women and two are on their period at the same time! God. Imagine how bad that would be?""



At first I generously thought that perhaps they were solely projecting their negative experiences with other [hyper-competitive TIMs](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/fun-competition.png) onto actual women (and probably some of them are), but that last quote blew that theory out of the water. It's clear that there's a whole element of [toxic competition](https://butchstudies.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/men-take-care-of-you-if-youre-a-lady.png) here that spills over into putting down ""biologic"" women, the ""real deal.""

The harness itself is made out of polypropylene webbing in a variety of colours?the fan favourite is rainbow. The metal snap makes it so the O ring can be replaced with a different size. The buckles are the exact same buckles that you would use on a backpack to tighten those straps over your shoulder, and because of that, you're able to fit literally any type of person.

913,2913,"Hi everyone. For context, I am a reddit ""poweruser"" who used to get angry about the transphobia I saw on reddit and elsewhere until very recently. In fact, I never imagined that I would ever adopt a belief that separates men and women, as more or less any study on reducing bigotry finds that lumping people together as opposed to separating them into 'us' and 'them' is the way to reduce bigotry. The bounds of 'us' and 'them' are socially-defined; however, because traits like race, ethnicity, and gender give rise to traits that are visibly identifiable, they are by far  the easiest ways to define 'us' and 'them', and powerful individuals and groups across cultures exploit this in order to gain control over others.

I have been aware of GC feminism for a long time, but one day, for some reason, I decided to stop and read it instead of just reacting against it. It confirmed things that I have observed from years of following various groups online (e.g. porn sickness, the social spread of trans identification, the muddling of women's issues by activism that perpetuates extremely harmful stereotypes about women, e.g. 'spoonies', fat activism) in addition to helping me understand some of my own deep-rooted behaviors - behaviors that, in context, were clearly the result of a socially-imposed aversion to displaying any female-typical thoughts and behaviors (i.e. 'weak' and 'emotional' thoughts and behaviors) - in addition to extreme internalized misogyny that caused me to stereotype and even loathe 'woman' as a concept for most of my life, despite the fact that most of my friends at that time were girls who clearly didn't fit that mold.



&#x200B;



Anyway, I've been allergic to the idea of feminism for most of my life. I hand-waved GC and radical feminism when I initially learned about it as a reaction to the idea of bigotry against an oppressed group of people (i.e. transwomen). And honestly, I do still believe that some people do experience a medical phenomenon that causes them to feel like they are in the wrong body, without any AGP or fantasy involved, and that transitioning may help them. However, it's clear that the vast majority of 'trans' and 'genderqueer' people are being influenced to transition for reasons that do not necessitate pumping their body with hormones and spending all of their free time on twitter and reddit.

I think my attraction towards radical/gender critical 'feminism' was cemented when I visited a 'feminist' bookstore this weekend. The speakers that were hosted there are very anti-idpol, but the books and trinkets...there was barely a book there about the condition of women and girls. I am completely serious. This feminist bookstore, which has been around for many years, had far more literature and paraphernalia related to gendershit than women and girls. In addition, they carried a ton of literature that perpetuates ideas about female weakness in addition to other trash, e.g. 'spoonie' ""books"" and ""art"", 'fat positive' ""books"" and ""art"", sex work positive ""books"" and ""art"", porn positive ""books"" and ""art"", divisive women-of-one-race vs. women-of-other-race ""books"" and ""art"", new-age materialist 'witchy' garbage that is somehow almost as shallow and capitalistic than the telecommunications industry.



&#x200B;



Aside from a handful of publications from a couple mainstream artists, there was nothing, and I mean NOTHING there that actually contained a message about the empowerment of women and girls. Almost all of the literature clearly peddled damaging stereotypes about the weakness of women and girls. There was essentially nothing in this 'feminist bookstore' that would actually cause a fence-sitter to consider the idea that women aren't weak. In fact, just walking through those cursed shelves would demonstrate to them quite the opposite. That women need novels about how to understand how to give consent. That most women are mentally ill or 'spoonies' (i.e. have at least one chronic condition that prevent them from going about their day-to-day lives in a normal manner). That women who walk into a feminist bookstore are so stupid that they need $10 comic pamphlets straight off of tumblr to tell them how to hurl a corporate bath-bomb into some 'self-care' water. Though, of course, the vast majority of the content there was dedicated to gender. As I mentioned, the only content created by or for women in this established 'feminist' bookstore was mainstream content that the average person could pick up at a public library.

As a woman who is just starting to accept and celebrate her womanhood, and as somebody with some serious physical disabilities who tries to work around them like the average contemporary disabled person - spoonie/online disability 'culture' just perpetuates and accelerates the belief held prior to the 'handicapable' movement and onwards, where anybody who has a serious disability is thought of and treated like they're unable to function on a basic level - I found this bookstore sickening. The fact that they clearly care more about transwomen and 'genderqueer' people (the entire ""feminist"" shop was painted with affirming messages about transhit), the fact that most of their ""feminist"" publications revolved around topics that mentally kneecap the women who buy into them, and the fact that there were tons of teen girls in the shop was extremely disheartening.

Using male versus female biology to voice barely concealed contempt toward us. Which, to me, is like a Cheetah bragging to idk a lion that he can run faster than she can. Yeah: we are fundamentally built differently. That's the point. We are a sexually dimorphic species. A man bragging that men are better than women is absurd, as you did nothing to earn that 10-30% advantage but be born. An example I saw of this was some conservative personality on Twitter posting a clip of women's collegiate basketball where some player missed an easy layup. Somehow, he made the leap to how the worst player in the NBA would be the best player in the WNBA (even though that had nothing to do with this random clip) and laughing about it. Like ha ha, see how weak and silly women's sport is compared to men. And the comments were just filled with people laughing at this clip and shitting all over the WNBA.

Abstract



The activist conjunction of sexual orientation and gender identity is questioned by demonstrating how the concerns of the transgender movement run contrary to an agenda of liberation from gender ideology. The confused vocabulary of trans discourse articulated in the language of somatic incongruence (so-called gender dysphoria) is exposed, using an analysis of the concept of somatic incongruence and the various interventions through which bodies are apparently restored to ideological congruence constructed upon, inter alia, gender, race, and age. The paper rejects transgender medical treatment and surgery as nothing but the most brutal affirmation of gender stereotypes and, in conclusion, calls for a radical and total disaffirming of gender, analogous to the termination of racial classification and segregation.",-1,1555193362.0,bcvwbb,29,GenderCritical

I identified as a trans guy from when I was ~13-18 (my current age) until I discovered radical feminism and learned about why I felt the way I did.



Throughout my teen years, I thought I must be trans because I hated being female with a passion that no female friend related to. I felt dissociated and detached from my body and everything feminine. My body felt - and still does - like a threat to myself and a permanent invitation for sexualization and rape. Most importantly to me, my sexuality *felt* male, because I had a visually-stimulated, ravenous sexual desire that didn't align with a feminine passive sexuality. Once in art class, when I made some nude art, my teacher told me I should instead make art that was more representative of female sexuality. I broke down because I didn't even know what that would look like. I was obsessed with male pleasure, and during sex with my boyfriends (another problem I still have) I could only get off by imagining what my boyfriend was experiencing. These ideas, and many others, all added up to a conclusion I was definitely a trans guy - but I think you all know where these ideas really come from.



I grew up with the understanding (as an itty bitty child!) that I was a girl, and it was a sad reality that boys were just /better/, and I needed to do what I could to make them happy with me. I grew up with a misogynistic father who sexualized me from a young age and taught me how to be a satisfactory female. He groomed me and isolated me from my mother over a long period of time, and this childhood has totally warped my view of gender roles and I'm still trying to work through it.



I was so happy to discover radical feminism and identify my internalized misogyny. I learned women don't have to fit into any gender role to be a woman.



But at the end of the day, I'm still dissociated from my body and hate all the pain that comes with being female. I still cry sometimes because I wish I wasn't one.",1,1555136598.0,bcnpsi,132,GenderCritical
935,2935,"So, last night at my university, there was a speaker who gave a speech titled something like ?Men are not Women? or something to that degree. From my understanding, he?s a right wing conservative guy, but, obviously given my presence on this subreddit, we agree at least on the surface level about transgender issues.



However, my university is rated pretty high in LGBT friendly campuses in the US, and students staged a counter protest across campus. People who disagreed voiced their opinions during the talk. Cool, okay, fine, that?s their right.



HOWEVER, a student stood up in the middle of the talk, and sprayed a mixture of lavender oil, bleach, and other chemicals in this guy?s face. She was arrested, but a lot of people are praising her actions.



The president of the university sent out a message today that basically said something to the degree of ?we don?t like what this guy was saying, so good on the counter protestors, but because we?re a state funded school we have to let him talk because free speech. Oh, and also spraying people with bleach is bad.? 



Now, as a gender critical radical feminist myself, I?m terrified to even say something remotely about my views on this subject anymore, especially since I now know that people I may have class with would be willing to spray me in the face with bleach over it.

I have some questions about Debra Soh. She's one of these people that gets accused of being a terf while actually believing that gender is a real, innate thing. She's a neuroscientist and while I don't think she owes anyone political support, I am confused about a few things that she never seems to clear up, even though she easily could, and is frequently given the platform to do so.



1. If every cell in a man's brain is XY, it would be a male brain, regardless of personality. How does Soh figure this isn't true?

2. She says she believes that hormone exposure in the woman causes transgenderism. Is there any evidence for this? 

3. And wouldn't it only mean a feminized male/masculinized female, not ""wrong body?""

> Methods: 

Twelve transgender individuals, 6 trans women and 6 trans men who had been accepted to start gender-affirming medical intervention, were recruited. Knee extensor and flexor muscle strength was assessed using isokinetic dynamometry at three different angular velocities (0, 60 and 90 ?/s). The assessments were made at four time points: (T1) before treatment initiation, (T2) four weeks after initiated gonadal hormonal down regulation but before hormone replacement, (T3) three months after hormone replacement therapy and (T4) eleven months after hormone replacement therapy. The cross-sectional area and radiological density of the thigh muscles were assessed by CT scans performed bilaterally at the midpoint of femur of each subject at baseline and after 11 months of cross-sex hormone treatment.



> Results and Conclusions: 

**Muscle area increased 17% in trans men** (p<0.001) with an 8% increase in radiology density after eleven month of cross-sex hormone treatment. **No change was seen in trans women.** There were significant (P<0.05) group x time interactions at each angular velocity. Thus, **while the trans men increased their strength over the four time points, strength levels were generally maintained in the trans women.** When averaging the three strength tests, knee extension (16%) and knee flexion (34%) strength increased from T1 to T4 in trans men. The corresponding changes in the trans women group were -6% and 0%, respectively. 



>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ~1 year of cross-sex hormone treatment results in increased muscle strength in trans men. Cross-sectional area and radiological density is also increased after testosterone treatment. However,** trans women maintain their strength levels as well as cross-sectional area and radiological density throughout the treatment period.** We conclude that the altered sex hormone pattern induced by gender-affirming treatment differentially affect muscle strength in trans men vs. trans women.",1,1555093134.0,bcgw69,608,GenderCritical

So first I guess my background. I am male, and have been transitioning waaaaay before ""bathroom bills"" were even a discussion. And I share so much of the sentiment this subreddit has about trans activism. 



1. The dangers of puberty blockers. Those things are often off brand cancer medications for Christ's sake. No wonder they have horrible side effects ruining bone density and cardiovascular health among others. 



2. The blatant disregard for the fact of biological reality. 

2.A - I have XY chromosomes, no matter how I Identify and no matter what I do with my life. I will have specific dispositions towards health because of that, and it cannot be ignored.

2.B - Even after SRS, saying that the neovagina is the exact same as a vagina is completely delusional. And I might add completely evil. Reducing a vagina to ""A F*ck hole"" is demeaning, objectifying, and wrong. It is a complete misunderstanding of female anatomy, and just shows how the vast majority of men in society don't care about 50% of the population.

2.C - Anything equating me to women is erasure of women. For Christ's sake, there is a problem when society associates ""Long hair, Pretty dress"" with ""Women"" than ""Vagina"" I don't belong in your spaces. I don't belong in your sports, I don't belong in your shelters. 



3. Disreguard for the permanency of medicines used. 

3.A - I am now at a permanent increased risk of seizures and other neurological disorders. I was aware of the risks when I signed up, and even developed schizophrenia later in life (Related or not, I don't know) but the majority of today's society treats it like damn magic.

3.B - Permanent changes to my cellular metabolism, especially in connective tissues and bone tissues. I have modified my diet to be Vitamin D and calcium and phosphate rich because of this, and I knew the risks when I signed up. And yet again, everyone in trans activism sees these pills as damn magic.

3.C - These pills aren't designed for transitioning. Spironolactone, the most popular testosterone blocker, is an off brand acne medication. Estradiol, Progestin, those are often off brand menopause medication. They have health side effects when used outside of their intended use. 



4. Enforcing gender roles.

There is nothing inherent about women that is ""feminine,"" and I can testify growing up surrounded by women who were rock climbers, boxers, mechanics, etc, femininity was designed to inhibit the potential of the women in this society. 

When I first began to transition, there was a lot of questions like ""Why do you want to be a woman in this society?"" Nothing! Hell, you women are treated like shit in this society. Men never leave you alone, doctors ignore you, and employers are already biased against you. 

Removing the transition from ""Body"" to ""Performative"" is enforcement of gender roles, and enforcement of patriarchy. There is a generation of people growing up right now who will regret their decisions to transition when older. I have never met a trans MtF who wasn't an absolute perv about women, and it disgusts me. I've never met a trans MtF who couldn't think of women outside of their performative gender roles, and it is abhorrent. 

I hate how trans activism enforces gender roles, lets men into women's very much needed spaces, and erases women.

953,2953,"I usually complain about how the trans ideology appropriates and denigrates womanhood, but I had some thoughts as to how the trans community harms its own people aside from that.



The first is that it preys on a very emotionally vulnerable crowd - teenagers. As we all know, no matter how you identify, your teenage years are a turbulent emotional time. Woman or man, hetero or queer, there's going to be rough sailing ahead. Certainly some have it easier than others, but I'm pretty sure that nobody makes it through their teenage years without some turmoil over who they are or what's their place in society.



Now enter the trans community. Vulnerable, questioning teenagers are told in no uncertain terms that if they do not start transitioning NOW, it will be harder later on. ""The longer you wait, the harder it is"" is practically a trans mantra. There's a rush to send these teenagers onto hormones as quickly as possible, or blockers at the very least. Unfortunately, HRT has a number of side-effects that will not go away even if you stop taking it. Men may become permanently sterile after only a few months on HRT. There may be physical changes that can never return to normal if you stop. Women's voices may become permanently deeper. The list goes on. It's a huge decision that the trans community encourages rushing people into, because the clock is ticking.



HRT is often ascribed almost magical properties by people early in transition, as if it's a wonder pill that sends you from man to woman in a reasonable time frame. Many of them soon realize that it doesn't do all that, and for some people, they may show little to no effect even after taking HRT for a year or more. It will soon set in for most TIMs that they will never pass as a woman.



And of course, passing is everything in the trans community. Those who don't pass often suffer crippling dysphoria as they're kind of stuck in between - not a woman, just a ""guy in a dress."" Unfortunately for them, most trans women will never pass. Even if they get expensive surgery after expensive surgery. Admittedly, some do a good job of it, but that's because they had androgynous features to begin with.



Nevertheless, the trans community sets these vulnerable teenagers on this path to disaster, full of permanent repercussions, often with the insistence that it must be done now and forget what your parents or even your psychologist has to say about it. If your psychologist doesn't approve, find another that will. I saw a post recently where a TIM talked about going through four psychologists until they found one who would approve of HRT.



Why does this happen? Well, I think you get these TIMs who have invested so much of their life into the trans identity that they can't possibly imagine that they could be wrong. They've sterilized themselves with hormones, they've isolated their families and social groups, perhaps they've even mutilated their bodies with surgery. It's not easy to look back on that and say ""I was wrong - I permanently disfigured my body because of a fetish or a mental condition."" The only option is to press forward. Some even deny that detransitioners exist and that detransition stories are just false flag propaganda by evil TERFs. I think they know, deep down, that the allegation is false but they desperately cling to this idea because the alternative is far worse.

The men in my department know all the right rhetoric to spew when it comes to equality for women in stem - but they don?t walk that talk. They dominate conversations, they?re condescending, domineering, and inappropriate. One on one, they make inappropriate comments about what we wear, about those with a marginalized ethnic identities, and constantly stifle women?s opportunities and growth. And none of us feel comfortable saying anything just yet because the department chair is male and a condescending prick and is one of the problem faculty.



My graduate cohort is a large cohort that, for the first time in a long time, is an all female cohort. And we are a staunch feminist group. We?ve sat in classes and collaborated on research together for some time now. Not all of us are radfems, but still they center women in their feminism for the most part.



We had a new male professor teaching adjunct last quarter and he was a dream. He was so humble, he gave space for us all to talk, was gentle and kind when he was challenging us to think about things differently. He was one of the best male profs we had ever had. When it came time to give our evaluations of him as a professor, we were told that it would factor into getting him a permanent job. Now, the thing with professor evals is that for those who have tenure, it basically doesn?t matter what the evals say bc the department doesn?t read them once tenure is given. But since our professor was new, they were paying special attention to his evaluations. With this opportunity, all of us absolutely laid into the department in our evals and wrote about how the males in the department are essentially assholes and that our new prof was one of the best things to happen to this department in a long time and he should absolutely be hired.



Our new prof was so concerned that he actually asked the department chair (male, condescending asshole) and the grad school director (female, amazing academic) to read the evals earlier than they normally would have (summer time) because he thought it was concerning that our all-female cohort universally had these experiences. This prompted our female grad school director to call a meeting with another strong, female professor, and they want to open up space for us to talk about sexism in the department and lay some groundwork for taking action about it.

I?ve been thinking about this issue a lot recently (more broadly) and been really stressing over this since the post yesterday about parents having their 3 yo transition. I have an infant son. I also discovered this sub about a month ago. And I?ve been trying to figure out how to do right by my son and by women and radfems.  



I always knew if I had a girl that I would let her choose what she was interested in and help protect her from ?pink? and princess culture, (but try to let her choose what she wanted to some extent if she chose that).   My sister has two girls and is having a bit of trouble with the fact that her 2 yo old *wants* to wear pink and princessy things, even though she?s literally never seen a Disney movie in her life and her toys are almost entirely primary colors (or full spectrum pastels) and gender neutral? my sister isn?t quite sure where the pink influence it is coming from.  My sister is struggling whether it?s feminist to buy her daughter the things she chooses when given a choice (pink sparkles) or to ?force? more ?gender neutral? colors and selections.  My sister tries to go ?neutral? with animals and dinosaurs and astronauts, but it is hard to figure out the balance without accidentally denigrating  ?girly? things as less than the ?boy? things.   It sounds easy but it?s proving difficult in practice. 



But reading this description of a 3 yo boy ?presenting female?, the feminist in me is saying, what does that even mean? That he wants to wear sparkles and tutus? What are they teaching him that he *cant do* as a boy? 



So for my own son, what does that mean? I go through my siblings? daughters? handmedown baby clothes for the gender neutral clothes ? should I be mixing it up? **Should I be dressing my baby boy in ruffles and pink onesies occasionally?** I do tend to lean heavily on sports and dinosaurs themes, because I think they are adorable.  But I do dress my baby boy *as* a baby boy and I don?t take the clearly baby girl clothes. And I would dress a baby girl in the same things, but with a splash of some more ?feminine? clothes. Should I be doing the same for my son? Should I dress him in the little strawberry outfit with the cute ruffles? Which is being a better radfem? I know pink and blue are not historically linked either way, but the clothes of today *are* gendered, and I?m the one doing the choosing.  What am I supposed to choose? Just boring primary colors to avoid all of it? But I have access to lots of free, gendered clothing and the plain primary colors clothes are actually much more expensive. 



Do I go out of my way to buy ?girl? toys? Not gender neutral toys, like puzzles and blocks and animals (he?ll already have those) and not even just dolls, but pink dolls? And I remember things things like my playdoh flower making basket? my brother didn?t have one of those.  And I loved mine. But there is nothing inherently ?not boy? about flowers (or there shouldn?t be). He shouldn?t think he needs to be a girl to play with that. So do I go out of my way to have balanced toy choices (not just neutral) so that he doesn?t think he needs to ask specifically for ?girl things?? Do I try to take bias out of it by already presenting it to him as *for* him?

I'm a scientist and a woman and this reaction really enrages and sickens me for so many reasons. I've done work with media people and outreach and this situation is horrible. I had to rant somewhere.



Firstly, the journalists are to blame for misinformation. When she gets inevitably doxxed I hope she calls them out on this. In all her interviews she is very clearly stating her place within a team and that her team is one of many. She did invent the very algorithm that creates the image and she is a team leader, but not the entire head of the project. The journalists keep captioning her as ""leader"" which is misinterpreted by others sharing the images. There's an obsession for journalists to find the head genius in any big science story and it drives scientists barmy:

&#x200B;



These huge projects are team efforts first and foremost. The official head of the project (Dr Heino Falcke) probably barely saw any of the code or even knows how it really works. But that's okay! Everyone contributes or you don't get authorship.



Secondly, the journalists know the public prefer to have a human perspective on a heavy scientific discovery. The black hole image is... Well, faceless so there is a frenzy to find something relatable amongst the equations and data. Dr Bouman is a gift to these journalists. In the world of scientific computing for radio satellites, she is young and pretty and witty in interviews. You'd think her PhD from MIT would be enough but remember it's how hot a woman is first and foremost. The public won't listen to female scientists unless they have sex appeal.



She had taken her own photos throughout the work, including ""the moment"" it all came together. She has experience giving a TED talk. The media storm around her is inevitable because the alternatives are frankly uninspiring on camera.



Angry Reddit misogynists have interpreted her outreach work as self-serving and I am truly dumbfounded. A person who wants to be internet famous and a celebrity does not get a PhD in imaging via physical model inversion.



To say scientists avoid media work like the plague is an understatement. My colleague's paper did well in the media and she locked herself in her office and cried at the prospect of being interviewed and photographed. My male colleagues are similar, and many scientists who know there will be a storm around their paper often flee abroad to avoid it entirely.



However, for many female scientists there is a sense of moral duty to do outreach work and try to engage with the public. Many of us had few role models and we are thinking of the young girls who need inspiration in a world that tells them they can't do maths. It's trying to give back, make things a bit better. In addition some of us truly enjoy our field and want to share it with others. When I see Dr Bouman's social media and talks it's the same vibe. She's not trying to be an Instagram influencer or get on Oprah.



I think most women don't enjoy being the token female scientist. I hate it when random people praise me for just working in a scientific field.  **This shouldn't be remarkable**. Getting media attention like this can feel like you're being pointed out as an anomaly rather discussing your contributions. So yes, women get media attention but it's hardly a privilege. It mostly feels like ""look at this female creature using her brain! Extraordinary!"" And again, first and foremost media cares about your sex appeal.



And finally as a computational scientist the GitHub sleuthing really got to me. The dude with 800k lines of ""code"" was mostly uploading lines of data, aka dogsbody work. Scientific programming is NOT software development. Dr Bouman's algorithm might be 10 lines long but it's the foundation and therefore a massive contribution to her team's work.

At some point last year I read a long form about the failure of Elizabeth Holmes' startup Theranos--how it was a medical startup that was basically way overpromising what it would be able to accomplish, and misrepresenting its progress till finally its failure to deliver anything was too much and it imploded. It had funding from all kinds of big investors in the Valley as well as a partnership at Walgreens at this point, so I can see how it made for a good bit of investigative journalism (apparently it was a reporter who first noticed things weren't adding up), but all in all, I wasn't that interested. It was more depressing than anything else. A woman gets buzz in Silicon Valley and it's because her company was a ""scam""? Great, just great.



Anyway, fast forward a few months and now YouTube's full of ""Theranos"" documentary recommendations for me. Apparently it's a captivating story for a good number of people out there. I ignored them at first until finally they wore me down and I decided to watch a professional-looking one. It's two guys talking about the company and Holmes and they restrained themselves for about a third of the video length till finally they come out with ""**the real politically incorrect reason behind her success is she charmed all those older men with her looks**""...and yeah....that's what I was afraid of. That's what I suspected was behind all this male interest in the story.



Look, maybe she's one of the most crooked people in the world. I really don't care. The point is whether she was successful or failed, it would have been the same story among the bros. ""She succeeded because she charmed all these men with her looks"" would have been the alternative buzz if she was successful. It's all about that male weakness for women that allows women to get ahead in tech and mess with men's otherwise perfect meritocracy (sarcasm).

I went to visit a family member who has a very liberal/progressive group of friends. They?re all queer, gender queer or GNC or non binary. He told me that one of his friends (whom I actually have known for years) has come to the conclusion that she is non-binary and that she doesn?t use she/her pronouns.



I?ve always thought I was really open minded and progressive, so I?ve actually been consciously trying to use singular ?they/them?more often bc I feel it?s polite and totally neutral. My response was ?ok great I can just use they/them? he told me no, that she doesn?t accept those pronouns. Her correct pronouns are ?per/pers? as in .... person. I was so confused bc she hasn?t changed anything, still wears the same clothes and has long hair. She?s most obviously female, and just labels as gender nonconforming. Also, she hasn?t changed her name and Its a woman?s name. People treat her the same and act the same around her. Changing pronouns doesn?t actually affect anything? So I started asking a bunch of questions such as ?well I?m not very feminine, is there criteria of being non binary? Am I non binary?? And he said no it?s something you just feel or identify with. 



If there?s no criteria, and gender is totally made up, why would it be offensive to just use female pronouns to go along with female body. I feel like it?s borderline offensive to think that bc you?re ?not like the other girls? that you are no longer a woman and don?t want to be referred to that way? How is that helpful in breaking down the ideas of gender stereotypes?

I don't want apathy to win out on this, and spend god-knows-how-many more years alone without having tried something. I know a lot of us are out there, but don't know how to connect.



With productive rage-fuel from dealing with the everyday realities of a lot of bullshit we discuss here, I decided to step up and do everything I can to bring community and friendship to fellow womyn in my local area. If any of you lovely womyn are in the metro Detroit area, and are looking for a radical feminist lesbian social group, please private message me. Our first meetup will be next month, but for obvious reasons don't want to openly spread the info on a reddit post.

Basic summary: 11 year old girl denied bathroom access and forced to bleed through her clothes. Mother complained. Issue happened again. Mother complained again. Girl finally issued special bathroom pass, though now traumatized to return to school. School gives hogwash statement about how they are for supporting menstruating girls and ending period poverty. This school doesn?t allow bathroom access during lessons except for students issued special bathroom passes ahead of time. 



I say, aside from the female abuse here (are all menstruating girls supposed to apply for a special bathroom pass now?), there?s a bigger issue at hand. No student, male or female, should be told they can?t use the bathroom. Nobody should have to justify their need. It?s no one?s business if you have a period, urinary tract infection, weak bladder, stomach issues, sudden flu symptoms, bowel issues, etc... (I remember being asked in front of the whole class why I needed to go to the bathroom so bad on multiple occasions. Saying ?I need to go to the bathroom? should have been enough. I still hate that school with a passion near two decades later.)



A few comments tried to defend the no bathroom rule during lessons because some students abuse it to wander or vandalize.



If someone wants to forgo their education with truancy, that?s on them. Any student caught breaking rules can be disciplined after. This doesn?t justify treating students like animals and denying them the dignity to take care of their body. Many have stated that holding it in has given them infections and later kidney problems in life. This bathroom restriction rule has caused many to avoid drinking water for 8 hours to avoid needing to pee during school hours.



Health comes first!



So... if you scroll through the comments (I tried linking to the article directly, but rule 8 banned my post), you?ll see how common this is to the point where students have urinated or defecated in the class (not necessarily all recent, but this shows we still have a human rights issue long over due). So many girls have been forced to sit and bleed through their clothes.



One parent in the comment section says, at the beginning of each semester, they meet the teachers and tell them outright what would happen if they denied their kid bathroom access. They have yet to have an issue.



Reading this, I think it?s a good reminder for parents to have the bathroom talk with their kids multiple times starting with when they enter school. (A few in the comment section say they raised hell when their 5 year old and 7 year old were denied the bathroom and peed their pants.) Tell them bathroom access is a human right and to leave anyways if the teacher says no and to refer the teacher to the parent if they take issue with it. It?s better to deal with the teacher afterwards than to have an issue right there in class or cause health complications. Emphasize this. The teacher can try justifying themselves in front of a human rights court if they decide to fight this.



Edit:  also, a few comments tried to justify the rule because having people leave to go to the bathroom during class would disrupt the lesson. I call bullshit on this. Nobody leaving the class has ever disturbed me. The only time class was disturbed was when the teacher specifically stopped the lesson to make a deal out of it, questioning why they didn?t go earlier.



Edit 2: teachers, perhaps you have a defence when the higher ups try to push you to enforce this rule. Freedom of conscience. Or something similar. I can?t think of any decent person thinking this is okay. 



Edit 3: I think the solution for kids needing to go to the bathroom without having to verbally ask is either developing a hand signal and the teacher nods at them or gives a hand signal back. Or there could be a sign out sheet by the door. They could initial beside their name when they return. So in case of emergency, the teacher has a list of names of students absent from the class. This could actually work better. It?s a written record of who left the classroom.",0,1554996048.0,bc14ko,148,GenderCritical

Steven Avery?s ex fianc? said he was sexually coercive, demanding sex whenever he wanted and referring to her as ?my vagina?. If you don?t know, Steven Avery is the subject of ?Making A Murderer? on Netflix. Basically, he went to prison for the murder of one woman. Years later, his conviction was overturned, but two years after that, he went back to prison for murdering ANOTHER woman. The series basically tries to prove him innocent beyond a reasonable doubt, and then to posit that he?s not evil, but the emotional trauma inflicted upon him by the justice system just FORCED him to become a murderer. 



And look, I know the US justice system is thoroughly awful. But by the time the documentary was made, he had already been convicted of the second murder. They act like it?s just a coincidence that two women he knew turned up dead. But because America hates nothing more than holding men accountable for their own actions, people bought it. Now, we?ve learned that he was abusive to yet another girlfriend, and people STILL somehow believe that he?s innocent of the first murder, and that he should get out of prison because he was unfairly forced into committing the second murder. This guy deliberately and violently murdered a human woman. Women?s lives just hold zero value in America.

I was abused as a young child multiple times. Emotionally, physically, and sexually. So preventing women abuse and making sure there is places for women and their children is a very important issue for me. A good friend of mine decided she wanted to start a women's group where women who were experiencing emotional issues because of abuse could come and talk to other women that have experienced the same thing. A place where women could feel safe. I thought this was a great idea and helped her with setting up a lot of stuff and even helped buy some stuff for the group sessions that were held twice a month. 



For the first couple of months it was pretty great. A decent amount of women showed up. We discussed anxiety, depression, signs of abuse, abandonment issues, attachment issues etc. A lot of women came and discussed what they were going through and we helped them a lot. One women who was in an abusive relationship, while we didn't talk her into leaving her husband, we did get them to both go to relationship counseling. I still talk with her, and he is actually no longer abusing her because of the counseling and us encouraging her to at least talk to him about how all of this makes her feel, especially with them having two children. I know some people might not think this is the best outcome and would have wanted her to leave him, but that was the best we could encourage her to do. She was very no on leaving. 



After the second month though, I think word got around about our group. At first we thought this was great, until a few men who were trans decided to join our group sessions. It was very clear they were trans, and they openly admitted it as well. We decided to let them stay because we thought it wouldn't cause too many issues, and after talking to most women in our group they didn't see too much of a problem with it. We all figured we could keep it about women. What ended up was the opposite of what we thought would happen. They started to complain about very small things. For example we had these papers we printed off each week for the women in our groups to read and take home. They were about how to spot red flags of abuse, they had suicide numbers, they had numbers to women abuse centers. A lot of times we gave out journals with them as well. One week we had papers on how to check for breast cancer and how important it is to get check ups as women. It had numbers and addresses to women doctors offices that would even help them pay for these things if they couldn't afford it. After passing these out and talking about them for a few, one of the trans spoke up and told us we should have added things for people like him. We were confused and basically asked him ""what?"". He spent the next twenty minutes explaining (our groups were only about two hours, one hour spent on talking about what we were passing out and doing a group project, the next hour letting each women talk about their issues if they needed help or advice on anything) why this wasn't ""trans friendly"" that we should provide numbers that help trans people. For example sex change counselors etc. We basically said this is a women's group and that is why we are only adding things for women. He said he was a women and these are women issues. We didn't really say anything after that, we were a bit uncomfortable to be honest. The rest of the group session went on, and we could all tell he was annoyed but we didn't really know what to say. He actually left the paper there and didn't take it with him. 



Then the next week after that during the talking part of our group him and his friend decided they wanted to talk about their problems. We learnt really quickly that their problems weren't actual problems at all and that time would have been better used to let any of the other women talk. They both just talked about how they were constantly discriminated against and how last week us not listening to them about adding trans support on our papers was proof of that. They then talked about how adding certain things would make them feel more welcome etc. We listened but I mean honestly no one had anything really to say. The women were a bit uncomfortable, and me and the main person who set this whole thing up were a bit annoyed because it felt selfish to us. We should have just kicked them out and told them not to come back then but we didn't. 



After this they started emailing me and the main women a lot. We always had our emails at the bottom of all of the pages in case any of the women wanted to email us at any time. They started emailing us that they felt left out. They started emailing us pages to print out about trans or LGBT papers to give to the group. We basically emailed them back and told them that we were not going to do this as this was a women's group and not a trans group. We did tell them we would print out anything for women who were lesbian, bi-sexual, or trans themselves. This wasn't enough because they specifically wanted us to print and give out things that were for trans women. They started to email us and complain about food we had bought for these groups. We didn't really think they actually had any real issues with any of this but were just trying to complain because we wouldn't be more accepting of trans people. 



The last straw was one week we had a police officer come in and talk to the women. He was specifically a police officer that dealt with abuse cases. He was one of the men who would go in, help the women, and take them to the women abuse centers or get them help etc. He explained what exactly happened, and he had brought in a women police officer as well who would deal with talking to the women or helping with things women would only want other women to help them with. Basically when situations got called in they would have one women police officer that would talk to the women, help her with whatever etc, and then two big male police officers that would escort the women to the police station and then the women abuse centers so they felt safe. He explained the whole process, and the woman explained how the women abuse centers were (not in great detail because of security reasons at the women abuse centers but a general idea). The reason the women explained this is because no men, including male police officers were allowed in the abuse centers unless there is a call of an issue happening inside. Since these places have high security there has literally never been an issue since the opening of these abuse centers in my area where they have had to go in. 



After they were done talking people had questions. Well of course the trans had questions. He asked specifically about what trans people are supposed to do if they are in abusive situations. The police officer said that they could call in and they would get them help. The trans then asked ""Yeah, but where do we go after?"" The police officer explained that we didn't have abuse centers in this area for men or trans. That they would most likely have to find a place outside of the town we lived in. The reason for this is because there just wasn't many cases of men or trans calling in about abusive situations in this area. In fact while they had worked in this town they had zero calls for men or trans. The trans then went on a rant about why he couldn't just go to the women abuse centers. The police officers were confused as was every other women in the place. To cut this short, he ranted got angry, complained and finally we asked them to chill out and we would discuss this later. At the end of the group session we asked the two trans to stay so we could speak with them. We told them we just couldn't do this anymore. That they weren't welcome here anymore, as this was a women's group and not a trans group but we felt they were making it about themselves. They called us so many names, even though we felt we were being really polite them. Transphobic was mentioned at least a dozen times, and while they were leaving the one trans called us ""dumb bitches"". 



After that we thought this situation was over with. That we could go back to a normal women's group with barely any issues. Nope. They started calling the people who ran the place we had our group sessions in. It was a free public place basically because we simply couldn't afford some place that cost money. They told them that they can't force us to let them in our group but the place was public so we couldn't actually kick them out either. So they started showing up during our group sessions but sitting away from us. At first they did nothing but stay there, and to be honest it was really fucking uncomfortable. But whatever we were like they can sit over there as long as they aren't bothering us. Soon after they apparently started up an LGBT group and would have people come in the same day and time we were having our group sessions. They would talk over us, use up the minimum space we had where we laid out things. They would talk over women who were speaking which would make the women feel bad. One time they were speaking extremely loud about how bigoted people shouldn't be allowed to speak anywhere. The groups just became really uncomfortable and a lot of women stopped showing up. Some women even emailed us explaining why they didn't want to show up anymore, and yeah it was because of the two trans men and the new LGBT group. Eventually the woman (my friend) who started the whole thing didn't want to continue doing it anymore, and we ended the groups. She was really upset about it and crying to me about how she just wanted to help women who had gone through the same thing as her and she felt this was unfair. That she wasn't bigoted but just wanted to have a women's group.

That was my first time ever being around any trans person. I was so upset over this and found it to be completely selfish and unacceptable. I have one other time where a trans person has caused a lot of issues for me (not that long after this btw) and I will post it later as it's more personal and I wanted to just post this first. Plus this is already really long. I'm just still so angry over this because it was actually helping women but men who think they are women because they wear lipstick and girl clothes think they have to be the center of attention, even in a group that is NOTHING about them. I'm glad I found this place because I honestly haven't got a chance to rant about this and most places I would probably be banned for posting this.

About 6 years ago, I was dating a girl, we?ll call her Angela. Angela told me that her parents used to be swingers, and it kinda saved their relationship. She and I weren?t really in a bad place, and we felt strongly about our confidence in our relationship, so we decided to try it for fun.

We posted an ad on Craigslist and got a relatively immediate response from a couple. The man was about 46 and the girl was 24. We met up at his place and the four of us hit it off. She went with him and I went with her. We?ll call this woman ?Sarah? from here on.

We did the deed, and went home. We felt okay with what happened and it didn?t really lead to any problems. Eventually, thanksgiving comes around, and Angela goes up to Kansas to visit her family for a month. After 3 weeks, I get a message from Angela saying that while she was there, she met up with her ex and is now pregnant with his child, and she promptly leaves.

Come around January first, I get an email from Sarah saying that she had fun and wants to meet up again. I explain what happened with Angela, and that I?m really only interested in a relationship, so if that?s what she?s interested in, then by all means, we can meet.

2 weeks later, we meet up and go on a date. By far the worst date I?d ever been on. We watched blackfish because she was an animal activist, which I respect but I teased her about it, but she fell asleep on me in the middle of the film and I finished it alone in her apartment. We met up about a week later for another date. Then another, and another.

After about 3 weeks of dating, I feel like things are getting serious, or have the potential to do so. At this point, I have a few things I need to disclose if this relationship is going to go any further.

I explain to her that I?m a) polyamorous and b) pansexual. If that?s an issue, I understand, because it?s something a lot of people can?t handle, and not something most people have encountered before. I explain that I?m talking to a few people but nothing is really serious at the moment. She says she understands and is willing to try.

Fast forward to two months later. She?s now living with me in my apartment, and I tell her someone I?ve been talking to is coming to visit, they got a plane ticket and came to Orlando to visit me. She immediately gets upset and starts yelling, then gets quiet out of nowhere. She says she understands and it?s fine.

Two weeks later, the girl comes to visit. She was supposed to stay for a week but bought a plane ticket back home after 3 days. Sarah took every single opportunity to make this girl feel like shit. She attacked her at every turn, degraded her and yelled at her. This girl went back home and I never heard from her again.

Sarah explained that it made her feel like she wasn?t important and that I was just another ?player? looking to fuck as many girls as I could. She cried and we talked about it and long story short I cut off contact with everyone I was talking to with the potential for romance.

Two weeks later, she asks me to hand her her phone. As I lift it the phone screen wakes up and I see not one, not two, but 30 messages from about 5 different guys all asking to meet up with her to fuck again.

I confront her about it, she lies, confront again, she lies, confront again physically showing her the lock screen messages, she lies. I then tell her to get out of my house, and then she owns up. Crying and yelling and saying how she ?did it think we were serious?. She kept saying ?give me my phone? and I set it on the bed behind me, telling her that we need to talk about what?s happening.

That?s when she puts her hands on my chest and shoved me as hard as she can. I hit the wall, and my immediate reaction is to swing back. I hit her. I told her to get out, pack her shit cuz she?s done.

If I?m being honest, I don?t remember much of the next three to five hours, but somehow we decided that she?d stay and we?d try and work on us.

About 4 months later, she goes on a trip with her family for some church thing. Naturally, I?m home alone, and so I get onto the laptop to crank one out. As I open the laptop, it automatically loads skype on her username.

I didn?t think anything of it until a fuckload of messages and notifications started popping up from a known ex of hers. All the messages are mentioning her by name and incredibly sexual.

She gets home and I confront her about the messages and she lies. I open up the computer and show her the proof, and she says ?someone must have hacked it and been messaging that stuff to him? (which is still the stance she takes to this day by the way)

She lied about that, but admitted that she never cut it off with him and they?ve been together behind my back the whole time. Somehow we end up talking it out and she leaves the guy, so we stay together.

Later on I bring up the topic of poly again, and she ?reluctantly agrees?. I start talking to people very slowly and cautiously, and I finally meet someone who I?m interested in. I tell Sarah about her and she immediately starts crying and screaming and throwing things.

After about a week straight of her doing this, I cut things off with anyone I?m talking to and we go back to monogamy.

After about 2 months, we get evicted from our house. A roommate who was a personal friend of mine moved in, stole 1500$ from us and left. It was my fault so I brought everyone to live with my parents. (Me, Sarah and our two roommates.)

One gets a job immediately and moves back to Orlando, the other gets a job locally and moves in with a friend of mine.

She gets a job as a teacher, and I start my own business.

I bring up the idea of poly again, and she throws a fit. Saying that if I want poly, then I don?t want her. She?s not enough and she?ll never be enough.

I ask her if she wants to try being poly as well, not just me, and she?s interested in the idea and we talk about it. I tell her that I?ll start slowly talking to/looking for a partner, and take it slow.

Within three days she had a date. Came home and told me all about it, including sexual details I didn?t want to know. She then had 4 more dates with 3 more guys over the next week. And I sat at home.

After about a month of this, I finally found someone who wanted to go on a date with me. Sarah freaks out and starts crying and yelling at me, and telling me not to have sex on the date with this person. I calmly explain that she had sex on each of the dates she went on, and I?m not specifically looking for sex with this person, but if it comes up, then I?m not going to turn it down.

I go to the persons house and stay the night. It does end in sex, and I leave and come back home. Sarah, is telling me about the date she had while I was gone and how she had sex and it was fun, and I start telling her about my date, and the moment I even mention the other person?s name, she shuts down and starts crying.

After about 2 weeks of her yelling at me and crying I cut it off with everyone, and ?she does too? (more on this later).

She explains to me that she wants something even longer term. ?White picket fence, a house, a dog, a ring, kids? so after about 3 months, we go to the courthouse and get married.

At this point she expected me to ?grow up? and ?move past polyamory?. She had expectations of me that she never once told me. When those expectations weren?t met, it very quickly turned to resentment and anger.

She would snap at me at every turn, screaming and yelling, crying non stop, telling me how horrible I made her feel. She told me I was a narcissist.

We ?tried? poly again, and it ended up in the same failure 2 more times, always ending because she would yell and scream and cry and tell me horrible things.

It?s at this point that my depression and anxiety are to a level they haven?t been in a long time. In the middle of a drive to visit her family, our car breaks down. She starts yelling at me and crying because I?m a horrible person and just want other people and to ?use her?.

It?s at this point that I open the door and start to walk into traffic, because I just want everything to be done. She stops me and we sit in the car in silence until we get towed home.

She finds me a therapist and we start slowly working through things. Talking about past traumas, my relationship, my mentality, everything.

About a year ago, a Netflix special comes out by Daniel Sloss. If you know this name, then you know what?s coming next.

In his stand up, he talks about how people?s lives are puzzles and they fill them with the things that make them happy, and if you?re not happy, it?s because you?re not being true to yourself (summarizing very poorly)

After about a month of thinking, I finally sit down with Sarah and tell her that poly is a part of me. That it?s not something that will go away, leave or change. That it?s something innate in me and I can?t get rid of it. She tells me ?it?s either me or poly? and out of spite, within half a second I said ?poly?.

She screams and yells and yet she still stays with me.

Eventually we get our own place. The day after we get our new house, I have surgery.

Now. At this point I?m not in a relationship with any other people. However I do have a very close friend that I work with who lives in Orlando. She sends a get well card to my new address.

Because I?m still recovering from surgery, I can?t really move around too much. Sarah goes to get the mail, comes back inside and throws the envelope at me and says ?one of your GIRLS sent this to you?

I already know what?s inside because she told me she sent it and what?s inside of it. I calmly tell Sarah ?there?s going to be a Metal Earth pirates of the Caribbean ship and a get well card inside of this?

I open it up and it?s exactly what I say. The card says ?get well, feel better, heal quick! Don?t cut yourself on the metal earth and don?t be afraid to use glue! - Mia?

Sarah screams at me for three days about how it?s a ?love letter? and that I?m doing shit behind her back.

I tell Mia what Sarah said, and laugh saying ?she thinks you?re in love with me, haha? and Mia says ?probably because I am?. I didn?t really know what to say to that so I kinda sat alone and though.

Mia and Sarah knew about each other, as Mia had bought things from me before, and we interacted with work stuff a lot.

Eventually Mia and I start talking more and start tentatively ?long distance dating?. Sarah knows and is upset.

When we moved into this new place I promised Sarah ?this is our home. Nobody is allowed in here without the permission of both of us?.

I finally get a new computer for work, and I don?t need my old one. Mia has been looking for a new computer so I offer to sell her my old one.

I explain this to Sarah and she screams at me for about a week straight, but eventually decides to sell the computer because we could use the cash.

I ask her if she wants to meet Mia, and she says yes. I explain to her that if she wants to meet Mia, then she?s gonna have to crash on the couch. As she lives in Orlando, and is a 5 hour drive from us. Since Sarah gets off work at 6 and it takes her an hour to get home, Mia would be leaving after 7 pm for a 5 hour drive, and I?m not ok with that.

Sarah agrees and we continue the day. The day before Mia comes to get the computer, Sarah asks what the plan is, and I tell her Mia?s gonna come here, get the computer and then we?ll go out in town for a bit to hang out, and we?ll be back by time Sarah gets home so she can meet her. Then Sarah and I can go to bed and she can crash on the couch and leave in the morning.

Sarah starts screaming at me that I?ve broken the sanctity of this house, and that I?ve been plotting this behind her back and that she had no idea I was planning this. That I ?never talked to her about this and this is all a lie?

Sarah tells me that she?s going to stay the night at a friend?s place and I can do ?whatever the fuck I want?.

The next morning Sarah goes to work. I wake up about 3 hours later to a ?get the fuck out of my house or I?m calling the police? text message. I calmly explain that this is my house too and she has no legal ground to kick me out.

Mia comes, buys the computer and goes home. Sarah gets home and she screams at me for 4 days straight.

She finally decides she wants a separation to see if the distance will help us and make us miss each other.

I take my computer back to my parents house so I can work, and stay with them.

After a week, she tells me that she wants a divorce and all my stuff is already packed.

I come by about a week later and grab all my stuff while she?s at work. The entire house is rearranged and every possession of mine is packed in a room by itself. I have a 3 hour breakdown in what was our bed, grab my things and move back in with my parents.

She consistently texts me and asks if I want to hang out, get dinner, have sex, watch shows or a movie. I finally tell her that if ?we?re done then we?re done, and I can?t talk to you, because it breaks me too much?

After 3 days, I realize I haven?t checked my emails since we?ve been separated. So I log in to gmail and it automatically logs her in.

I go to log out and see that there are about 40 emails from kik, and a bunch from other dating sites. Turns out she?s cheated on me with over 70 guys over the course of 3 years (that I can prove)

Also, within 2 days of the ?separation? starting, she threw a party in our home. She?s gone to non stop party after party.

Turns out, the only reason she wanted me to go to therapy was because she hoped he would ?help me get over poly and grow up? and stop ?faking my mental illnesses?.

She has my car, my house and she took everything but my job from me. She hasn?t filed the divorce papers yet even though she surprised me and had me sign them.

My birthday is next month on the 4th. And I?m terrified that she?ll have the final papers sent that day. I?m terrified she?ll come to my parents house. I?m terrified that she?ll get even more vindictive and drag me through the mud.

She?s already spread blatant lies about me to mutual friends and outed me as pansexual and poly to my friends and family.

I genuinely don?t know what to do anymore, and everything reminds me of her. And a part of me still misses her and wants to drop everything to give her whatever she wants. I haven?t heard from her in weeks and I?m falling apart.

What should I do with what I feel? Where do I go from here?

25,25,"I am typing this with probably the most painful stinging in my chest right now, but I need to share this somewhere. This does contain spoilers for Endgame so... Yeah, if you don't wanna be spoiled, this is the warning. Also... This is gonna be long.

TW for suicide.

So

After Infinity War, there was a time me and my friends had gathered at the ice cream parlor, all trying to relax after what we'd seen. In our conversation, I cracked the joke: ""Hey, what if we dressed up as Avengers for the next movie?"" It wasn't thought about much until a few months later, when Endgame was announced. It was then I brought it up again, this time with the intentions of it being a simple get together.

Of course it was then that my mental health went into a downward spiral. 

My nightmares came back, I was growing paranoid, and anxiety was kicking my ass almost every day. My dad wasn't much help- his laziness and lack of responsibility was weighing on the bills, and my mother was catching up on her own. So, I began to get as many hours as I could for my two jobs- even to the point where I would leave one job only to immediately go the the second. The hours were ruthless, and while I still somehow made time for helping my siblings with homework, I was becoming mentally and physically exhausted. 

It was then that something came by my mind; the plan we had for Endgame. Our get together. It'll be just like the old days... It'll be the one day we all are a group again. I'll actually be there to spend time with you all. Just like old times back in high school, when the most I had worry about was school, and trying to forget my stalker even. It was all easier when you guys were with me.

When the movie was coming near, the plan was forming... And I felt almost at peace putting it together. You guys seemed odd about it, especially when cost came into play.

I was offering to pay for everything for two reasons: One- I was willing to pay any amount of money for a chance you guys will be there for the movie. 2- I wanted my goodbye party to be the most stress free for you guys. I didn't want any of you to worry about money like I normally do, and though the cost of both the tickets and the costumes drained what I had saved, I didn't care. Money was useless to me at the time; once I was gone, I didn't have to worry about it anymore. I wouldn't have to spend long nights feeling ready to keel over from the aches that plagued my body constantly. 

You guys started getting suspicious of me when the premiere day came near. I was talking off, I'll admit, but I was keeping my plan under wraps. I was intending on the night going like this: we gather, get dressed, go someplace we like to eat, see the movie... And I leave the group when we come back. I'll sneak out through the door, go to the train tracks, and wait. It'll be quick, peaceful (I Always loved the sound of trains), and most important: it wouldn't be at home, so I didn't have to worry about my little siblings seeing me. 

The day came, and I felt all kinds of things. I was worried I wasn't doing enough for you guys, and I was wondering if I owed you guys anything else. I didn't. When we got back together, I was so happy again. I never felt so happy in a long time. We met up, we ate... Then we went to the movies. A few people took pictures with us, which was flattering; but I really wanted to see the movie. We got our seats, and the movie started.

Something changed. Like a switch was flipped. I can't say what happened, because I really don't know. But watching the movie, seeing the bonds they had.. It just reminded me of you guys. We were, are, and always will be there for each other. I remember nearly crying when Black Widow and Hawkeye began to fight over who's going off the cliff; it wasn't just because I wanted neither of them to die. 

Then I saw Tony. When he sacrificed himself like that, and when everyone around him, everyone who loved him had to watch him die... I officially changed my mind. I cried for many reasons for that part, from his death all the way to the funeral. So many people loved him. Seeing him gone broke them, and... It was then I knew if I went through with taking my life... You guys would be broken. And I just... Couldn't.

I will admit I don't regret yelling during the return of characters, and I'm glad you all yelled with me. I am glad that we all cheered with the audience, and I am glad to have had a change of heart.

I'm glad I didn't do it. 

I went home that night, and had a short sleep, but... I'm alive. It sounds cheesy, but.. I feel at peace. And while it may be temporary, permanent, or whatever, I promise not to let that happen again. I won't give in to it. I'll fight it for as long as I have to. It brought me to my knees, but I got up. 

You guys supported me for so long, and I feel like the most piece of shit friend for still letting these horrible thoughts of leaving you all come into my head. 

Thank you guys. You really don't know what you did for me, and will probably never know about this... But thank you. I love each one of you and I will try to take control back in my life. My chest doesn't hurt anymore. And when I get home, I'll schedule an appointment with my therapist. I think she deserves an explanation for why I've been missing the previous appointments.

26,26,"This might not seem like a major ""off your chest"" thing but it is just something that I need to get off my chest. Ok so here goes. 

My dad died 3 years ago the other day and 3/4 (my youngest wasn't born) of my kids took it really hard. They absolutely loved and adored their pap-pap. My 7 yo (4 at the time) daughter is still taking it really hard. She misses him so much. She talks to him all the time, writes him letters, colors/draws him pictures. Well she asked me the one day if we could send the stuff she made/got for him to heaven so he could have it and play with it (she gave him some of her toys). I told her yea. Well we put the stuff in an envelope or package and my husband takes it to ""put it in the mailbox"" on his way to work. On the envelope or package we write ""To: Pap-Pap"" and then where the address goes we write ""Heaven"". I put the stuff up when she's not looking or sleeping so I can give it to her when she is older. I write the date on everything. My 5 yo son does it too and when he does I ""send"" it too but not as often as my daughter does. 

I feel really bad for lying to her about it but she gets super excited when she's making stuff for him or giving him one of her toys to play with so he's not bored and has something to do. I just hope that when she is old enough to know that you can't send stuff to heaven that she doesn't get mad at me for lying to her all these years.",0,1556375752.0,bhznn9,2,offmychest

28,28,"Man. Even typing that, I feel disappointment in myself. I grew up in a bad home, left at 17 to my best friends, emancipated, as I started my business. I had a promise to myself that if I ever did become a father (never wanted kids) I would be the best, and grateful for my children.
My girlfriend had/has an extremely easy pregnancy, healthy baby, one any struggling parent would shun me for not having gratitude. Everything is perfect, she?s even an easy baby, sweet and pretty. She does make the most adorable noises, and cries rarely. Extremely happy baby. Already and she?s only a month old. 

But almost every time I hold her, I feel a pit of resentment to myself and the woman I had her with.
Someone I was so passionate about just one year ago. 

When we first started dating, I was ecstatic, we were friends for 3-4 years, I always knew she had some issues with her father and home life, in a way we bonded over that. 

She moved away to another city for a year and a half, we drifted apart. I had my growing business to focus on, she wanted to get away from her hometown. Eventually she moved back.

When we started hanging out again, the feelings were unavoidable, we were so much fun together. When we were friends, hanging out was so much fun, every night together was memorable.. then, Every single ?date? we were on, was ecstaticly fun. Ridiculously. She?s an outgoing spirit, I am too. We both can be wildly fun, the life of the party. All of our friends were happy to see us together, and a lot of them had been trying for us to see this happen for years.
It really felt like we were perfect for each other. I felt on top of the world.  


Then, 4 months into this new relationship, almost a year after she moved back, she came pregnant. I was excited, how could I not be. I?m having a baby with my best friend, this won?t be easy, but nothing in my life has. I can handle this, and with my business exploding over the last year and a half, I can support us. My life, I finally feel somewhat complete in this. I was excited 

To make a short story out of this, 3 months into the pregnancy I found out that the first month of our relationship she was cheating, still seeing a guy that was in a relationship until about 3 weeks into our serious relationship (at this point, we had agreed to be exclusive)

I won?t say I didn?t know she could be promiscuous, I will say that I didn?t think she would do that to me, her friend; and at that point romantic partner.

I immediately grew distant. Resentment, not hatred, but for a while I couldn?t stand being around her. Even now I still get these feelings and have to take my time away. I don?t know how to make them disappear, for me cheating was awful, the worst thing that someone could do, and generally a major deal breaker for me. My father would cheat on my mom, leave town with women and I?d be home with my mother and hear her crying, eventually becoming old enough (9-10) to understand what was happening before their divorce.

Since then, our relationship went from good to immediately sour. Over the course of a week I completely shut out, and over months fights became worse, insults thrown. Resentment built, all while pregnancy was blooming. Eventually, at 7 months into the pregnancy I decided enough was enough I?m going to look past (she really fought and has been fighting to earn my trust and repair what she broke, I truly believe she wouldn?t cheat again and would never break the family unit, she doesn?t want a broken home like hers was either) 
I know I?m the problem, I can?t stand to think about the cheating and it makes me resent her. 
I feel like a push over, I feel weak. Like the image of my mother sobbing on the couch while my dad did as he pleased. I know it?s not that way, I know she?s trying to rebuild this relationship. I know it?s me now that is making things hard, but I feel a lot of resentment, especially around her. I had baby with a cheater, a family with a cheater, and there?s nothing I can do to escape that reality.

Also, why am I even trying to go to school and get good marks if any kind of work that I?ll have to do later on sounds unappealing.

40,40,"On the night of June 17th, my wife and I were making our way to Oklahoma from Louisiana to share in celebrating her Sister?s wedding. My wife was meant to be in the wedding, standing by her sister on one of the most important days of her life. The drive would be 8 1/2 hours, and we knew we would likely pass through a bad rain storm along the way. We had taken special points to have her car completely checked out to try and minimize the risk as we made the substantial trip to Tulsa.   
 

The trip had gone without incident for 6 hours  and we found ourselves driving on a dark Texas highway near Paris around 11pm. At this point, the rain that had been coming down in thick sheets was finally slacking off. I even looked over to my wife and commented that we had made it through the worst of it-only 2 ? hours left. Nothing could have prepared me for how positively wrong I was. Not 10 minutes after I made this comment, I saw in my rear view mirror one of the most haunting images I have, or likely will ever see:  
 

Headlights.   
 

These headlights were bearing down on us faster than I ever could have thought possible. I had enough time to say out loud ?we?re going to be hit?, try to maneuver the car away from the person careening towards us at nearly 100 miles per hour, and offer up one word, half in prayer - half in panic. ?Help?.  
 

The moments that followed hung in the air for eternity. The incredibly loud sound of metal on metal, the lurching, terrifying feeling of being flipped forward by the force of the impact without the airbags to catch us, the horrifying, crushing pain from rolling hundreds of feet, all encompassed with the panicked feeling that these moments might be our last on this earth.  
 

Silence is all that followed. The stark contrast between the deafening pandemonium one moment, and the oddly peaceful quiet that came after was like something out of the movies. I will never forget the urge to panic when I looked over and saw my wife writhing in agony and confusion, I will never forget the pain of my injuries, and I will never forget the fear that fell upon me when I watched my Wife...my best friend stop mid-sentence, go unconscious, and leave me wondering if She had taken her last breath.  
 

Thankfully, though, people heard our cries for help amidst the rain that had been falling unaware of the situation it landed upon. We were pulled out of the vehicle, brought to Paris, TX and Life Flighted to a Medical Center a few hours away. My injuries included broken ribs, a sprained ankle, a sprained wrist, a dislocated hip, a dislocated shoulder, and two broken bones in my right arm as well as extensive bruising. My injuries, however, were nothing compared to my wife's. She had broken ribs, a thrice broken femur, a broken fibula, 3 torn ligaments in her knee, a sprained ankle, a shattered wrist, trauma caused by impacting the airbag-less dashboard which included a broken bone under her eye socket and resulting in severe eye sight loss that still hasn?t returned.

These injuries would be enough to quell even the strongest of spirits...but my wife, the strongest person I have ever met in my entire life, met each and every challenge with more determination than I ever could have imagined. Her sheer force of will captivated the entire floor of nurses, and even caught the attention of the head of the Hospital. She is my hero.

 

I have found out since the accident that the young lady that hit us had been drinking that night. She also admitted to being on her phone at the time of the accident, and she was so inebriated that she had thought she hit a dog...

41,41,"We dated for three years. We lived together during college for two. I was a year ahead of her in school, and I graduated last May and moved four hours away for work. We were doing the lost distance thing for 10 months, and then two weeks ago she ended it. She was accepted into the masters program at her school, so we would have had to continue doing long distance for another two years. She said it would be too hard, and despite seeing the writing on the wall, I have totally fallen apart.

We're still friends. And I believe we will always be friends. After two weeks of reflection, I decided this was probably for the best. We had fairly different career goals and I knew that would become an issue in the long term for us.

But it is the loneliness that is killing me. Every day since the breakup, I have been feeling absolutely no motivation to go to work. I aquired a great, high paying job right out of college. And right now it means nothing. I am doing less at work, just waiting for the clock to hit 5:00. I see people around me in their happy relationships, getting married, and I think about myself and my brain just spirals into every stupid mistake I've ever made with no way of stopping ... I hate myself. I hate that I can't control what I'm feeling.

I've started drinking more. Every day after work. It's the only thing I look forward to on weekdays. I also (finally) found a weed dealer in my new city, so that's a thing now too.

I decided to use this breakup as an opportunity to explore my bisexuality. I have always known that I was bi, but never had the chance to experience something with another guy. So I get on Tinder, Grindr, and Bumble and start making some connections. And I found a guy. It was so weird because of how quickly we matched each other and just how much we had in common. We hit it off. We texted every single day for a week and planned a solid first date. Well, that fell through. And the day after that he started acting weird with me and not replying. Well, this sort of made me absolutely freak out. That whole day I was anxious that I did or said something wrong. I probably shouldn't fall apart for someone who I hadn't even met in person yet, but I couldn't help getting so attached so quickly ...

I don't know how to get better. I don't know how to move forward. I have been fantasizing just ending it all many many times in the last couple of weeks.

I'm a 20-year-old girl, and I've never kissed or been kissed, never had a boyfriend, never have been intimate with anyone.  
Even though it bothers me, I reassure myself by telling myself that 20 years old isn't that old and I'm still young and it's could still be considered normal by most. I really believe that.  
But sometimes there are things that remind me of how inexperienced I am, and how I wish I was more experienced. Earlier today I was watching a youtube video and they were talking about their first kiss, and the mistakes they made during their first kiss, and I had no idea what they were talking about (well, I understand the theory).  
When I was younger, I dreamt of my first kiss and hoped it would be romantic. It was important to me, and know I feel like now I'm too old for it to be the sweet innocent kiss I dreamt about. And I still kind of do dream about it, but not that much anymore...  
The worst part about not having kissed a boy is that it's wasn't a choice I made. There just never have been any boy interested in me, and I don't know why.   
For a long time, I thought it was because of my physique since I have been overweight since I was 10 and obese for a few years now. But I realized that even if it was unattractive to some guys, that couldn't be a turn off for every guy I met.  
So it must be my personality. And that's where it gets tricky. I don't know what's wrong with my personality.

I went to an american school and it was my first contact with English language, culture and education system with this school. I first met this kid who started being my friend and he was about the same age but a school year more. We lived in the same complex and he along with his brother invited me to his house to play videogames. Everything was cool with him until there.

Later after, he started being a fake and being an asshole because he probably found new friends and thought he was super cool because he was into Korn and Metallica. I was around 14 and he was like 13. We shared the same school van to go to school since we kind of lived close and he started saying horrible shit to me and my sister for no reason, or I assumed, to look tough in front of friends. He completely lost friendship with me and started being a complete piece of shit. 
There are many episodes in which he acted like a total bully to me and my sister, who was probably 3 years younger than him. He once grabbed her lunchbox and threw it against the ground, breaking everything she had there. He once crashed her finger against a reclining seat, causing her a gash. She was 11 when this happened. Other things were that the dude thought he was super badass playing soccer so he gatekept everyone he did not like in the game. He once fouled me real hard causing me a subtle injury. One day while playing soccer in recess I confronted him and almost got into a fight, but the bell rang and acted like nothing happened.

What a beautiful woman. What had happened to her? I didn?t know what to do, so I did what I was accustomed to. I took her into my arms and held her close to me. I don?t know for how long, but she eventually pulled away and said, ?I?m looking for something that you probably can?t give me.? 

She stared directly into my eyes. She longed for something. Someone to love her. Someone to care about her. I couldn?t give that to her tonight. I couldn?t hold her and tell her how amazing she was or how important she was. We had just met. I couldn?t give her the love that she needed. We had just met. 

?I?m sorry,? I said because I didn?t know what else to say. I left her place right after that, with nothing more than a kiss on the cheek and a look I?ll never forget. If we had met at some other time, at some other bar, with some other circumstances, she would have been the woman of my dreams.

Before tonight, I was just trying to get drunk and forget my ended relationship. While she was trying to find the one she desperately wanted. This world is such a strange place.

For the past year I have been clubbing 2-3 nights per week. At first I used to love it. I came from a very strict upbringing so when I turned 18 and started paying my own bills my parents gave me all this freedom. It was so fun being drunk all the time, and the occasional MDMA roll.  

Around 3 months ago I just got so bored of it. It was the same shit every night. I started realising that club people are quite shallow people (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). All they know is beer and drugs and didn't want to do anything else. Everything they do is for popularity/status. 

I am so bored of clubbing. The only reason why I keep going is because thats the only thing my friends want to do. I suggest road trips bowling,  group activities that provide a genuine connection, but they just say 'my ideas are gay'.

It's now been a year and a half since I broke up with my ex (1 year relationship) and alot has happend between us. The first few months after our break-up we still behaved like a couple. We met up, kissed and still loved each other but she just did not want to be in a relationship anymore. It frustrated me so much. Then things got bad. She started seeing another guy and at that point I tried to stop all contact between us. After a few months I recieved messages and letters from her saying that she missed me and did not want our friendship to disappear. She told me that she broke up with the other guy and that she just wanted to wait and see what the future would bring and what would become of us. So I started seeing her again.

Also, my baby fell off a makeshift bed (that was in her room for me to sleep on)about 1 foot into a padded and carpeted floor, because, looking back, I was horribly sleep deprived and wasn't thinking straight probably due to lack of nutrition. (I had no help then...still don't really, but that isn't important). We went to the ER and they said she was fine, but it still shook me to the core.

That was nearly 2 years ago. My child turns 2 in about a little more than a month (beginning of June). She is ahead on every milestone and, like her middle name suggests, she is the Joy of my life. Unfortunately, the surrounding circumstances are less than ideal, but she is truly a ""unicorn"" toddler. Or maybe I think that the toddler years just aren't as bad as the newborn phase since I had an incredibly difficult newborn with colic that I had to handle on my own. Who knows? 

Anyway, I didn't originally talk about any of this, because the fall happened. I felt that if people knew I had terrible thoughts that they would think the fall wasn't an accident (it truly was and I hate myself to this day for it even though my child is very advanced...I'm talking she is starting to read and the librarians at storytime point to her and say that ""she is the one who can read"" to the other librarians). So I kept it all in. Even if I committed suicide, there would be no evidence of these thoughts since, well, a bullet would have pierced the only place these thoughts were stored.

Now that there is a significant amount of time that had passed and no major events, I feel like it is finally time that I can tell someone.

The truth is that I planned my suicide back then. I was going to plastic wrap my bed and surrounding areas before I dropped my newborn off at the local fire station. Then I would come home and shoot myself in the head. Then they could just roll me up and throw me away after. I was even going to seriously do it one night, but my daughter actually fell asleep on the way to the fire station and I was able to regain some hope.

I honestly chose a gun, because I had tried a few different ways before (nearly two decades ago - belts break, you puke, etc...) and I needed something quick, irreversible and sure to do the trick.

I also reached out to someone that night. I won't ever tell that person, but that person pushed me away. I wanted to say ""I'm going to kill myself"", but instead I just let that person know that it was ok and that I wasn't mad at that person or anyone. I later learned that person was playing an elaborate game with me that started a little after I got pregnant because that person wanted me to be a better parent or something crazy like that. It also helps that I can't tell that person, since I don't talk to that person anymore nor do I want to - for the games the person played left it's intended scar.

75,75,"On mobile, but not sorry about the formatting, deal with it or don?t, just getting shit off my chest: 

I am new to the profession of education, I started with high hopes and ambitions to be the difference, be the teacher I wish I had growing up. As a 25 black latino in America, representation is HUGE in the world of education, and I knew that my role would be important in helping uplift the next generation to be great and believe in themselves. I taught High School English in Colorado, in a district with 85% Hispanic population, yet literally 90% of teachers staffed are white and often unable to truly connect with the daily struggles these kids face, Trumps election was a nightmare for many of my students who then began to fear that their families may be deported. Anyway, my rookie year teaching, I had a knack for it. I actually felt prepared in my year long residency despite going into massive debt to become one of the lowest paid professions but that?s another shit filled rabbit hole I?d rather not go down in this post. Throughout the year, however, I was harassed by my coworkers. 

I received an email from one (white male) because I allowed one of his students to be practice her presentation in front of my advisory that explained that my actions negatively affect every teacher in the building and everyone has an opinion about my style of teaching, this was almost verbatim. My then principal (white male) decided to host a restorative meeting in which he sat in silence and allowed this veteran teacher to continue spewing toxic jealousy onto a first year educator. We have a full time ?instructional coach? (white female) on staff who?s sole job is to observe teachers and give advice and coaching, as the name suggests. However, my coach saw me teach for literally  all of 15 minutes for the entirety of my first year, but spent time weekly with another first year teacher (white male). Despite these altercations and many more I could disclose here, I was nominated for ?Rookie Teacher of the Year? by the district for my classroom assessment scores and the growth students showed. I hosted and organized the schools very first Talent Show (no extra pay), hosted an after school video game club (no extra pay), as well as a during lunch LGBTQ club (no extra pay). Against my better judgment I returned to the school that next fall (this past August) because of the students. 

Things between coworkers and myself were even worse, despite a huge staff turnover. Seems as though my skin color was enough of a deterrent that I wasn?t invited to staff outings, wasn?t spoken to in passing in the halls, or welcomed in the staff lounge. I walked in to grab something out the fridge one day and as I entered I heard laughing and words exchanged but after they saw it was me that entered, it became dead silent and everyone proceeded to look at me. I said ?wow, this makes me uncomfortable, why?re y?all staring?? One teacher (white female) then explained that if I felt uncomfortable it was my own fault... really?? It?s my fault for feeling uncomfortable when you stare at me? Okay. You right. My bad. Anyway, among the huge staff turn over brought a new principal (white female) whom I confided in that I didn?t feel welcomed by the staff but am here for the kids, I really loved my advisory and the bond we shared. She brushed this off. The following week the district needed forms submitted for the new clubs that?ll take place that year, this time they?d be compensated for those who put in the time. I submitted forms for the LGBTQ and video game clubs I started the previous year and thought it?d be nice to finally be compensated for the time I?m putting in. However, the principal gave the LGBT club to a new staff member (white female) in order to ?share the wealth.?  It hadn?t even occurred to her that it wasn?t her club to just give away to someone new. Things between myself and staff were just as uncomfortable and fucked up as they were the previous year and I?m not sure why I thought to even come back. But the kids, the kids are the center of my work and I thought I?d rough out the school year for them... that is until a student (Latino) decided to post on his Instagram page this past December that ?there are teachers fucking students at the school,? of course this gets massive attention by his following and he further spreads rumors to different students saying it?s Mr X and this person, Mr X and that girl, Mr X and this other girl... (I?m Mr X if that was hard to follow).  

His advisor (white female) sees the post and then reports me to the principal, which I understand, we need to ensure the safety of our kids first, but even after she reported me, she said nothing to me about it. Pretended that I wasn?t under investigation and tried to collaborate with me the whole time. In January the principal drags me into the office and then catches me up on the whole rumors and investigation and discloses that I?m not under suspicion any longer. But the thing is, why was this believed in the first place? Something so flimsy, something that literally anyone could say aloud. The principal began to grovel and pretend as though she cared about my feelings in the situation but it wasn?t genuine. Had she truly cared, the boy who posted these slanderous rumors would have been more seriously reprimanded and there would have been a public announcement to devoid the rumors of any validity. But there wasn?t. Another month rolls by after the investigation and I missed a day of work to be with my sister for her birthday. I returned to school the next morning with several students asking where I had been with a loon of concern on their faces. I asked why the look and they skirted around the topic until finally one said ?we?ll we just thought the rumors were true and you had been fired? 

That hurt me to my core. That these kids I had given my all would believe something said about me that terrible, and I knew that the rumors were still spreading, I could feel the tension and the stares from my kids ever since January when school got back in session.  I left work early and went to my HR rep and got approved for FMLA pending therapist recommendation. I thought taking time away would allow for me to heal and for the school to fix their wrongdoing. But it didn?t, nor did they. I then took my story to a cousin of mine who has been an attorney longer than I?ve been able to talk, and she knew that i had a case on my hands. Not only was my name slandered but I was clearly discriminated against in the workplace. I called my union rep (white female) and told her my story as well as what my cousin suggested I do. At the time I was venting emotionally, but a bad idea because now I know the union rep really only has the districts best interest, not the teachers. Weeks of back and forth with her and the assistant superintendent (white female) and they pitched me the offer to sell my contract and resign from the district, meaning that I?d receive my regular compensation and health benefits until September without needing to work for them again. I took the offer and forfeited my right to sue them. I?m trying to still get over this but I truly do not know how. I had a real passion for education and had ambitions of owning and operating a school with a unique curriculum that would inspire the country to change their approach to education. But after all this, I lost the flame. I was scorned by my coworkers and administration. I was even scorned by the very kids I decided to stay in a toxic environment for. It?s been a month since I?ve signed the papers but im not over it. I?ve been going thru a crisis since then in trying to determine if I should move to another state, try another profession, go to law school, move abroad, etc. I still have no clue. But I?ve been getting high much more than usual to avoid what I?m feeling.

Anyway, on 4/20, ironically, I received a phone call from the principal (black female) of my old elementary school. She had saw my accomplishments and things I?ve done in the classroom that I posted on social media, and asked if I would be interested in teaching at her school as a middle grades English teacher. I didn?t expect the phone call, let alone a job offer, but I hesitated. I decided to tell her what happened to me while I?ve been living in Colorado and she was shocked and saddened. I let her know that I truly appreciated her thinking of me for the position but I?m just not sure if education is something I can get back into. Although I told her I?d think on it,  I?ve sense been sober (day 6 now) and it?s extremely hard. Cannabis is my coping mechanism through this shitstorm that I survived and now I have to take an extended break from it just to piss clean in another state. I hate that we have this fucked up State Laws versus Federal Laws debate and especially over cannabis. But that?s it. That?s what I needed to get off my chest. I?m still very much so lost in what to do next with my life but dealing with the now is hard enough.

77,77,"First things first... we met in high school. She knew about my sexuality before we graduated. We're both 40 now. And we had dated briefly when we were 18, during our first year of college.

Second, I've always wanted to move to the city I'm in now. No (Milky Way) regerts there, just regerts in the way it happened. Also, I've been friends with her (now ex) BF for over a decade.

&#x200B;

So a bit over a year ago, her BF was visiting the city I used to live in (he came up every couple of years to hit up some breweries, and I suspect, just to GTFO). He hit me up, asked if I wanted to go out for a drink, I said sure. We grab some beers, he mentions they'd broken up. This was a bit before Christmas a couple of years ago. He suggests I give her a call to say hi on Christmas, as he thinks she's probably gonna be lonely. He also mentions she's probably looking for a roommate; he was still paying his half of rent on the 2 bedroom apt they had been in, but it was an expensive apt, and she didn't make enough to cover it.

Well, we've known each other for most of our lives, so of course I call and say hello on Christmas Eve.  She's a bit shocked to hear from me (it'd been a couple of years since we'd talked). It winds up turning into multiple phone calls. Her birthday is in January, she knows how much I love the city she lives in, suggests I come to visit. I do.  The predictable happens during the visit.

We wind up a couple. I sell/give away everything I own aside from my clothes, PC, and car. I rent a moving truck and trailer, move what little I still have across the state, along with my car.

I'm fucking miserable. She's incredibly controlling, always tries to flip everything around to being me getting mad at her for ""stupid reasons"", with a side of blaming her mood swings on ""her ADD meds"" (she's been on amphetamines since she was 13). I have a lot of friends in the city I now live in (many of which I've known over 20 years), and it took over 6 months before I was ""allowed"" to see a friend (and that was to pick him up from the airport). My phone was blowing up for an hour, nonstop.

Pretty sure she's just assuming that I'm going to dump her for the first guy I see. I've always cared about her, I always will, and I don't want to hurt her. But everything I do is heavily criticized. The way I drive (... that's probably a legit complaint), the way I cook family recipes, the friends I have (I used to be heavy into drugs, and I've remained very close friends with friends from that scene who cleaned up), even my work hours, and why I ""can't get a real job"" (I work a couple of 1099 jobs, and make significantly more than she does, but I don't work a ""real job"" because I set my own hours). I've even been told ""wow, I've never known anyone poor enough to buy clothes at Goodwill"" (seriously? they have some awesome clothes if you dig a bit, and I'd rather put money in savings vs going to Macy's)...

I guess the tl;dr is her worry that I'm gonna dump her for a guy is basically making sure I will dump her for a guy (or at least, dump her). I don't like dumping people, and with only one exception, I've remained close friends with every ex I've had. I owe her a lot for helping me move to the city I really wanted to live in, but the mental hell I'm going through makes me want to sleep under a bridge.  The only upside at the moment is since I'm a contractor (therefore don't have a ""real job"" according to her), I set my own work hours, so I'm able to set my work schedule completely opposite of hers most days.",0,1556360456.0,bhxqos,2,offmychest

He was obviously popular in our class for being a witty, talented person. Toward the end of year though, I realized something, he was me. The me that I always aspired to be. He was schooling his acads and he was an avid learner. His talents and creativity knew no bounds. He had a friend circle wider than Earth itself and he was the most comedic person I?ve ever seen. He even had the family that I always wanted. A sister that wasn?t the spawn of satan, an older sibling that was there for him, and a present mom. My reaction of course wasn?t anger or envy to 613 and even my family, but despair and sadness. I beat myself up over the fact that If I had made myself better, I could?ve been just like him. If you were expecting an inspiring and bright end to this then just throw that out the window now. It isn?t always that people have the strength to rise up and do better. It isn?t always that they have the willpower to ask for help. Sometimes, we are weak and just powerless to do anything about it. I wanted that kind of life but, I can?t reach it. It?s by my own accord that I choose not to reach it, but I yearn for it every day. It?s an endless cycle of me blaming myself, not having the power to fix myself, and then blame myself for not trying enough. I just wanted to release this thought and alleviate the pressure it?s had on me.

84,84,"I really fucking do. I forgot about you for a while because it was the only thing I could do; it was the only way I could function. In the middle of the night a couple of weeks ago, I woke up to you flowing through my mind. It was strange. I had forgotten about our relationship, but the feelings I felt were running through my veins. My stomach had butterflies, and I let a wave of nostalgia wash over my mind. I don't know if I miss you, or I just miss the times we had together. You treated me like shit, yet at the same time showed intense interest. Your friends said you were trying to make me jealous, but is that the truth? Were you interested, but the only way you could get my attention was through trying to make me jealous, or was it that you truly didn't care about me. The sad thing is that we never officially dated; we were always stuck in this limbo. You were two years younger than me, so our relationship wasn't legal, and we both knew that.

&#x200B;

I've never had feelings like I had for you. I remember you asking me if I had a facebook, and then you accidentally spilled the beans: you already knew the answer to that question since you had found it, already. Little did I know that you being my lab partner was going to the best and worst decision of my life. In the second week of class, I remember looking over at your phone; you had my name with hearts as my contact. I would of made moves right then and there, but again, any relationship we had wasn't legal, and I wasn't willing to put my life in the hands of someone else. I learned that through growing up with my father.

&#x200B;

I remember driving around at night with you. You would play your songs that I couldn't sing along with since I didn't know the lyrics. I was always bad at remembering songs. I miss you jamming out in the car while I shittily tried to sing along.

&#x200B;

I remember when your parents were gone, and we drank while hanging out in your pool in the back. I remember when were fighting with water guns in Walmart. I remember you poking me all the time in class to make me twitch. I remember how you would look at me. I remember how I felt every time you spoke words. I wish I would have made a move. I wasn't scared. I mean I was. I was scared that our age difference would cause problems. I was scared how you had so many friends to hangout with, while I had none because I just moved there out-of-state.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I remember you were always hanging out with other guys. Granted, it was a group of guys that your bestfriend hung out with, but it made me feel insecure; they were a threat to me. It sounds so stupid now that I write it out, but I wasn't going to chase a girl that constantly hung out with other guys. I pushed you away for that reason, as well. I felt that you weren't a stable enough choice, but I regret it so much.

&#x200B;

I remember that I started dating a chick from my work when we had our second semester together. You would always questioned me about her. Who is she? How did we meet? How old is she? Are we going to last? I remember our other lab partner then getting mad at you for being nosy. Haha. God that was funny.

&#x200B;

I remember when you started dating that one guy. He slowly stole you away from me. You would constantly put pictures of him on snapchat. Again, I was never sure if you did that because you wanted to make me jealous or because you were really into him. I've always wondered. I felt like we were in some battle of who could make the other person more jealous.

&#x200B;

I remember you talking about how you were going to go on trip with this guy and his friends. You came back next week looking like complete shit. You said that you guys drank like crazy. You made sure that I knew that.

&#x200B;

I remember when you invited me to come over and hangout with your friends. You guys were pretty drunk and high, laying on the roof while looking at the stars. You had just got your wisdom teeth removed that week. You were on pain meds, yet you were still drinking and smoking. What happened to the girl that hated those things? I lectured you on it, but you wouldn't listen. Eventually we all went up to the roof to lay down and watch the stars, again. You remember the guy that you had told me about a couple of weeks before? The guy that you said you knew since middle school? The one who I told you to be careful of? The one you told me was disgusting in just how he acted, didn't shower, treated people, etc? I remember. I remember you purposefully cuddling with him in front of me. It broke my heart. You did it for a while as I just laid next you. You may it painfully clear that it was to make me jealous. Finally, I told you that we needed to go downstairs and talk. You fought it. You were slurring your words, saying you were drunk. The only reason you came downstairs is because your friends said I sounded serious. You sat on the couch while I asked you what was up. Why were you drinking while on pain meds? Why were you cuddling with this guy in front of me? What is going? I felt like I was in movie; it was so surreal. You said that since we weren't dating, you could do whatever you wanted. I told you that you needed to stop this stuff, and stop hanging out with these people. You said I sounded just like your ex. You didn't care. You eventually said I was the bad guy for trying to talk you about stuff while you were drunk. You said that you were going back upstairs and that you didn't care. I told you that if you did that, any friendship we had was over. You left, and our friendship was over. To make sure you were safe, I texted your best friend about what you were doing and left our relationship behind. 1 year gone. I don't think you thought I would actually carry through with it, but its been two years now. Two years.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to think anymore. I remember times like that night that make me regret ever meeting you. At the same time, I remember that your parents were going through a divorce, and I turned a cold shoulder towards you because you were playing games with me. I remember you got caught with weed at church, since someone ratted you out. How stupid was that? Gosh, why would you do that? I felt so bad for you. I remember seeing you before class all sulken, and I wanted to give you a hug so bad. I wanted to wrap my arms around you, but you did something a week before, that I just couldn't. You said you weren't going to class, and left.  I wish I would have hugged you.

&#x200B;

I remember us being in class one day, you looked me in the eyes, and said I was like a brother to you. It was weird. It was out of nowhere. It had no context what so ever. Even our lab partner questioned it. I always wondered why you had said that. You waited, looking at me in the eyes after that, almost waiting for a reaction. You were waiting for me to react. I just acknowledged it and went along with it. It seemed liked situations like that were common. It always seemed like you were always doing something to try to make me jealous, and it pushed me away even more. I'm a stubborn person and couldn't allow myself to give into something like that.

&#x200B;

I remember the last time we talked, after our big fight when I said this was the end our relationship. It was months later, at the end of the semester. We hadn't talked for about two months. I texted you and asked if you wanted to talk about things. You agreed and said tomorrow, since you were hanging out with your friends. You sounded so excited. The next morning, we met at starbucks, and it went a lot different than what I expected. You didn't have the bubbly personality you usually had. You were monotone, and you said that I was just a ""backup"" to you. That's all I remember.

&#x200B;

We really haven't talked since then. You've texted me around every 4-6 months asking how I am doing. The first one I told you to leave me alone. The second time, I told that I was doing fine. The third time, we chatted a bit and you asked if I would want to hangout. I told you that I didn't want to continue our friendship. That's the last time we had talked. It's been 8 months since then, and I have barely thought about you; however, you have been popping up in my head, lately.

She was an amazing girl. She was caring, beautiful, she always wanted the best for me. She was my motivator. Recently, I began having these gut feelings that our relationship wouldn't last and she wasn't ""the one"". I began having them consistently and I would be so hurt that I felt them. I was confused about why I even felt them. My friends were too. I tried my best to fight through them and talk it out with my friends and just get past those feelings, but I couldn't. I told her and after a gut-wrenching two days, we broke up. She couldn't take it, she told me that when I realize I want to come back, she won't be here. She says she deserves better, and I agree.

I didn't deserve her, she didn't deserve all of that. She deserves someone who loves her the same way that she loves them. She's been through a lot, and I've added to her trauma and I can't forgive myself. I taught her that even if she tries her best, it won't be enough. I hope she can forgive me. I was confused, I didn't know what I wanted... She never deserved any of that. I wish she never met me. My friends are saying that she is saying that she's incapable of love, but I think the opposite. I don't know if I loved her, I doubt I did because if I did I would've never had the feeling to end it. I'm probably being dramatic, but I hope that she can forgive me someday.

I am adopted from Vietnam at the age of 9 months, or so. I was adopted by an American family. I've always felt different. It might have been the fact that I was the only Asian in a community full of Native Americans, Whites, and Hispanics. Or who knows, maybe I had an extra arm coming out of my head. I've always been severely bullied. If you're Asian and if you've dealt with racism, you know the usual degrading insults like ""Ching chong"", ""chink eyes"", and ""Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees and look at me"". It made me feel like complete shit as anyone would feel, I would assume. In the middle of the year of 2nd grade, I was taken out of public schools and put into home school. Except, I didn't do anything. I was young and clearly, I didn't know what the shit to do and the adults of the house didn't give a shit. The whole no educating basically slaving away fiasco lasted for about 4 years. When I mean slaving away, I really mean slaving away. We (my family) lived in a pretty big house considering we had a huge family. Well, every day, we had to clean every inch of the house. We had to pick rocks up from the property (which was also huge and in the area we live in, getting rid of rocks in quite useless). Many of us (the adopted kids) also dealt with physical, mental, emotional, verbal--you name it--abuse. We were told many times that we were going to be sent back to Vietnam, that there were many reasons why no one else wanted to adopt us, that when we were taken back to Vietnam we'd end up as hookers on the streets only to be found dead in a ditch. I also encountered almost being lit on fire. I've talked about the person who tried to do so about this and they said it was the only logical punishment.

&#x200B;

Anyways. Time passed and the person who abused us was a victim of an attempted murder by another adult figure in the house. Well, all of the kids had to lie and were manipulated through the whole process. We had to lie to counselors, CYFD, the police, social workers, etc. We were also put back in public school and I was held back a year. However, recently I found out that I shouldn't have been held back as I tested above the school, as well as the state. Anywho's. The whole court process lasted up to 5 years and due to the amazing justice system, it is still going on. I've come out with the truth and what I knew about the attempted murder and nothing has made a difference. During the 4 years between now and the attempted murder, I was fucking depressed. I self harmed, I planned my suicide, I attempted suicide, etc. I was fucking alone. No one cared for me. Literally. I am not trying to victimize myself. I had no friends, my family/relatives were doing pretty swell because they had an amazing social life/support system and yeah. I never left my room aside from going to school. I went to school, came back home and went to my room.

&#x200B;

Well, fast forward to now, I am still a depressed piece of shit. I know I am at a better place, I know I should be grateful and I know others have it way worse than me. I'm not depressed because I don't get what I want, I'm not depressed because I want more than I have, and other stupid reasons. I'm depressed because I hate myself. I know, it sounds stupid. But I've never been liked. My siblings once had a vote on who's the prettiest and ugliest in the family and I was voted the ugliest. I hate myself so much. I'm skinny and tall. I have medium, black hair. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I hate my stretch marks, I hate my eyes, my hair, my smile, my hands, everything. I know, this is such a typical teenage post. But I'm on the edge of ending my life. I want to pursue a career, I want to get a good education, but I wake up and I literally stay in bed and look at the ceiling. I don't go on my phone, I don't entertain myself. It's like, my mind is motivated and wanting to learn and grow, but my body is paralyzed. I feel so worthless and lazy but I can't. I can't do anything. I can't think, I can't concentrate, I can't even move. I don't even know what I'm doing here.  I need input. Honest input. I don't need any sugarcoated shit.

91,91,"Two weeks ago I thought my life was over because I didn't get into grad school. It was all I ever thought my life was leading toward, I never thought I had any other option but to stay a student for the rest of my life. I didn't know how to cope when it all fell through. I didn't know how to conceptualize a life outside of what I'd planned for myself. I always treated my life like a videogame I was trying to get a perfect run on, and if I fucked up and locked myself out of something, there's no point going on. But... I don't know, I numbed myself enough with mindless distractions to avoid thinking too much about planning the actual act of killing myself.

Irrational thoughts are a terrifying thing to experience because of how incredibly stupid it always feels once you're out of them. I can't believe I ever believed that stuff. I spent all that time thinking I was a failure for not getting into anywhere I applied to, but my advisor told me that literally everyone else had that same problem and rejection rates were at an all time high this year. I thought I was getting a worthless degree that only matters if you have a phd but for god's sake, it's a 4 year stem degree, of course I can get a job with it. I had my standards so high for graduating with every possible honor that I've been burning out in slow motion for the last 2 semesters, but... with my catastrophizing standards so high, I forgot that I'm still graduating on pretty great terms for an average person. I'm not even 'locked out' of grad school! There's nothing stopping anyone from just doing it later! What the hell was I thinking?

I think what set me off is that one of my students wrote a little thank you for me on a paper I'm grading.

A little background on me: I?ve been in a loving relationship for the last year and have never this happy before. We?re currently long distance and hoping to close the gap in a little over a year. I can?t wait to really start my life with him then. In my eyes, he?s the one for me. 

I started a new job a few weeks ago at one of my ideal companies to work for. Instead of working on my own (like my last job) I now work in a team of 3 others. Everyone has been super nice and helpful with the on boarding process. 

A few days into my job I started noticing one of the guys on my team a bit. He?s similar to my type (on the short-ish side with facial hair) and has a cute little accent that really adds to it. I didn?t really think much of it until I started getting little butterflies sitting beside him in meetings or chatting with him. 

Now, I don?t think there?s anything wrong with noticing someone and there being an attraction while being in a relationship. Why I?m nervous is because in my last relationship, I did cheat. I was not in a healthy relationship, was incredibly unhappy and couldn?t leave, and infidelity was a means of escaping it. As terrible as I feel about myself for cheating, part of me doesn?t regret it because I learned a lot - I learned how badly I needed out of the relationship that was breaking me down mentally and physically. I also learned I want to be a loyal partner and not stray again, ever. I don?t want to be the ?once a cheater, always a cheater? type of person. I know who I am and I?m a good person, and I?m not defined by my bad choice (or so I try to tell myself). 

You?re probably wondering, ?well, if you say you?re not going to cheat then why are you nervous??. Well, mainly because I associate feelings of attraction in a relationship with my past, and because I have an inkling he might be interested in me. He?s asked to grab lunch with me before (just 1-on-1) and I?ve usually just made an excuse so I don?t put myself around him more than I need to. Lunch might be harmless, right? Well yesterday after a work happy hour we both left at the same time and were chatting. As we were about to head our separate ways, he says ?hey, any chance you want to take a walk??. These could all be completely harmless and I?m blowing it out of proportion, but after that I don?t think so. Even if I didn?t have a boyfriend, I wouldn?t go there because we work so closely together and I really like where I work, and wouldn?t want to mess it up. 

He seems respectful enough and yes, knows I have a boyfriend. At the moment I?m not able to distance myself much from him since we?re on the same team and have a few clients we work on together, and he?s able to help catch me up to speed on everything and provide context while I?m still new. Unless they do a team move around, or he gets promoted and moves to another team, I?m likely stuck with him. 

Part of me feels like I?m crazy for being nervous when a) I trust myself and know I wouldn?t do anything (first and foremost). I love my boyfriend and wouldn?t do that to him. And b) he hasn?t even shown a crazy amount of interests/seems respectful anyways.

I'm not privy to the details of the first accusation (from the family of a girl his girlfriend used to babysit), but there was apparently no legal action taken (they were small town folks, so my best guess is it was a ""if we ever see you again you'll regret it"" type situation.) This time it was his step-granddaughter and her parents, likely taking the previous event into account, immediately pressed charges. He left town (the mark of an innocent man, surely) but was found and arrested at his parents' house. A year later, he's just had a preliminary hearing and is boasting to anyone who will listen about how apparently half the evidence was stricken by the judge and that his lawyer said they had ""a big win.""

I have zero evidence to back up my opinion on his guilt, just my own personal perception of all the creepy things he's said over the years, like talking about the underwear the first accuser wore, or, most disgustingly, joking about how she was ""bald"" when someone else made a pubic hair joke (that didn't involve children), among other weird shit like being a member of a website back in the day that counted down the days until the Olsen Twins' 18th birthday and making creepy comments about other young teen actresses. He also makes more references to things like deletion software than a person with nothing to hide would and gets extremely paranoid about really fucking inconsequential shit like e-mail addresses (his laptop's webcam is taped over, too) and used to have cameras set up outside his front door with the monitor in his computer room and would make other people answer the door unless it was someone he was expecting (even the day he was arrested, he had made his elderly mother answer the door.) The problem is, it sounds like a lot of the testimony included things like these, which while damning in the court of public opinion, aren't admissible in a real trial (but clearly some evidence still exists or else there wouldn't be an actual trial coming up.)

He's also a racist, misogynist, abusive asshole and a big part of me hoping he would be found guilty is so that he'd finally experience comeuppance for being such a general piece of shit his whole life.

So why am I still in contact with him? Personal weakness, I guess. Another part of me hoping he'd go to prison was so it'd be easy for me to cut him out. Aside from my brother and grandparents, he's the only family I have contact with, and my relationship with said grandparents will get extremely strained the moment I come out against their little angel. There was actually a large period of almost a year where I didn't go out of my way to talk to him after I first reflected on everything and decided that he had probably indeed touched the first girl (and yes, this was before the second accusation even came. That's how weak I am.) It contributed heavily to my depression, which left me near suicidal for a long while until my friends, one in particular who I wouldn't even have the courage to post this without (on a throwaway account, so brave), helped me out.

TL;DR: A piece of shit has been unable to cut a bigger piece of shit out of his life even after the larger turd has twice been accused of child molestation.

117,117,"I (f) have a friend (m) in my social circle who is really close with many of my closest friends. He's a nice, chill, down-to-earth guy, albeit a bit awkward. I was at a mutual friend's birthday party a while back and both my boyfriend and I individually had some really nice one-on-one conversations with him and really hit it off. We both exchanged numbers with him to hang out again in the future, maybe make dinner together as both he and boyfriend both love to cook. 

&#x200B;

After the party, he messaged us casually a few times to say it was nice to chat, we should hang out, what are you guys up to this weekend? However, as time went on, he always messaged me and not my boyfriend. Over time, his chatting with me became more frequent and more personally engaged?i.e. proposing deeper conversation topics, asking more personal questions about me, generally wanting to engage on a deeper level than what happens in casual messaging with someone you just met. I always deflected when it felt too personal for our level of acquaintance, and I would just keep my answers short and non-descript, but polite. As he's a close friend of many of our closest friends, I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

&#x200B;

After some point, it finally hit that tipping point where I realized something else was going on here. He asked about my weekend plans and I said I was exhausted from work and just looking to take it easy. I'd been complaining about my job and made a dark joke about the sweet release of death, to which he responded, ""Well, maybe we should just run away together"" in earnest. Uh, what? 10 minutes later, in an attempt at glossing it over, he dropped a winking face with tongue emoji, as if to imply, in hindsight, that he had been joking. 

&#x200B;

I left the message on read (I know), but I didn't know how to respond. Should I drop it? Should I say something? I asked my boyfriend, who was disappointed to hear about our exchange because, of course, his comment, but also because he seemed like a cool guy. He gave me some harsher response suggestions, but I ultimately decided I just wanted to keep it real with this person in a polite way. A few days later, I replied to apologize for taking some time to respond and explained that it was because his comment made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I said I hope I wasn't reading into it, but I respected him enough to honest with him and hoped we could just let it be water under the bridge. He never read my message and (coincidentally?) got a new phone number. A week later he messaged from his new number as if nothing had happened. I did not respond.  

&#x200B;

This would have all been an awkward, unwanted exchange I could leave in the past if I didn't regularly see this person at social functions. We were at a close friend's birthday party last night and it was so awkward. I avoided him, circling around and catching up with other mutual friends, and he couldn't decide if he wanted to avoid me or address me and was generally just hovering around awkwardly. An additional element is that he has a great, super cool girlfriend who we also hit it off with. She came up and gave me a big hug and couldn't believe it had been so long since we'd seen each other. I complimented her necklace and she gushed, ""Oh, \[my boyfriend\] actually gave it to me for Christmas! It's great, right? He has pretty good taste."" So, in addition to all the awkwardness around finding a way to being true to myself and my feelings and being polite to this person in the presence of our mutual friends, I also am concerned for his girlfriend, who likely has no idea. 

&#x200B;

I don't feel like I can talk to my close friends about it, as they are close friends with him, but I don't know who else to talk to about it. I think the thing that makes it the most challenging for me is that the comment (and the increasingly frequent and personal chatting that preceded it) was very subtle and casual and could be easily misconstrued as a misunderstanding. I feel frustrated because I'm angry at this person for his inappropriate behavior and inability to address it, but also because it makes me doubt myself and my experience of what happened. This isn't the first time I've experienced this dynamic out in the world, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

Remember when we all use to crowd into that tiny room to play table top RPGs?

The assistant manager that he told this to was a close friend of mine at the time and seemed excited for me; I soon learned that she was not as she never spread that information along, lied to me about meetings and promotion information and basically sabotaged my promotion to summarize.

I was suffering financially (minimum wage is not living wage) and had so many unexpected expenses thrown on me all at once (I had one sick cat and another die resulting in almost $1K in vet bills, needed new lenses in my glasses, $800 worth of car repairs, a lot in medical expenses because I?ve been having some serious medical problems this year, birthdays, my dad had an unexpected surgery and I had to pay the bills while he was off for recovery, etc. the list honestly goes on and on) and really just needed something to work out for me. I had drained my savings to support myself and my family (while still only being 18) and was killing myself doing so.

I was given my raise in September and also told that I was being promoted to manager, which would mean $11 per hour. They wouldn?t give me a straight answer on when I was going to start training until November - during which I was told that I would start training in January.

Because I was still suffering financially, I started looking for a second job in December and started that second new job in January of 2019. I switched my hours from days to nights at the restaurant (which they were okay with) and started working 50-60+ hours per week between both jobs to catch up on bills.

I started training for management in February, only after I cornered the district manager himself and asked him about it. He?s a great guy himself, he?s very appreciative of me. Him and the VP both are. They?re just very busy and unfortunately don?t work in-store with me. But they?re stand-up guys nonetheless.

I trained for a solid month and a half until I had to switch day jobs again because my other one wasn?t giving me the hours that I needed. I took on a full time day time nanny job (which pays twice what either other job does/did) and had to change my shifts at the restaurant by an hour (instead of coming in at 5, I?d have to come in at 6 instead. This is an easy change, they do this for other staff members all of the time. It?s a regular shift for it to start at that time).

While telling my GM about this schedule change, I told him the reason for the change and explained how my other job had removed me off of the schedule almost completely (cutting me down to like 5 hours per week) with no notice and that that was why I had to quit. I couldn?t pay my bills.

And what do you know.. the following week he cuts my hours to 5 hours. And the week after. And the week after that.

I was livid. I know he did it intentionally because we don?t like each other (professionally we get along, but personally we do not. He?s a very condescending and self entitled person and when he speaks poorly to me, I call him out and tell him to either change his tone or stop speaking to me). He also doesn?t like that I have been labeled as ?teachers pet? to the district manager; he likes me a lot and wants to keep me as an employee and has yelled at our GM on my behalf, which my GM resents and has held against me despite it being his own fault. When I asked my district manager about being promoted (since it?s his call and the GM wouldn?t answer me when asked) instead of the GM finally, the GM said I went ?behind his back? and was ?upset about it?. If he did his job right, we wouldn?t be in this situation right now. It?s bs that his personal bias is affecting my job. He?s on thin ice with corporate right now for other reasons (complaints from other employees, selling expired products, etc.) too so it?s not just me either. I?d have no issue with him if he just did his job correctly. He did this to himself.

When asked why he cut my hours, he told me that it?s because - and I quote - that I have ?sh*t availability and have shown no desire to show more?. I have the same availability as virtually all of the other night shift workers. I also always stay later to do paperwork and documentation work that only managers do - which I am not paid to do yet, by the way! I am only making minimum wage! - and cover all shifts that need to be covered when asked.

I do my job right. Every. Single. Manager. There has told me that I?m their best employee, with the exception of the GM. I have multiple positive reviews from customers online and in person, glowing letters of recommendation (6 of them, to be exact) and have had customers physically pull my district manager and Vice President aside during a walk through to tell them how wonderful I am and that I deserve a raise. So many of my customers are like family to me now. I cried when one of them came to tell me that her husband had passed. I celebrate their successes with them and enjoy hearing about their day. I have worked my ass off to build important and meaningful relationships with them and the staff and have done my best to make this job count for something and it has showed. I won our yearly award for best employee. I have received rewards from corporate throughout the year for being one of the best ones there as well. I have literally had customers try to get me to come work with or for them instead of at this restaurant because they think I?m so wonderful.

But I have no desire to show more hours (I.e. make myself available to them 24/7) so I?m not worth the promotion? I haven?t been trained in nearly a month. I?m ignored or spoken to in a condescending manner when I try to learn anything new. It?s clear to me that I am not being treated the way that I deserve here. They have now shown any *desire* to give me any reason to stay. For Christ?s sake, they don?t pay me enough. Minimum wage is not enough to make me a slave to you, nice try though. I?ve also offered to relocate to a different store for training if it means more hours (which is done frequently) and they haven?t done that either.

So, I am turning in my two weeks notice. I still have my day job which isn?t enough long term, but it?s enough to pay my bills for now. I will find another second job that will be better than this one. I?ve already scheduled some interviews.

I also wrote an email to our district manager explaining why I felt that this job isn?t for me anymore and I?m going to send it as soon as my two weeks notice is in. He deserves to know why his ?favorite employee? is walking away. And why this promotion isn?t enough to put up with the bs that goes on there.

Screw it. What a waste of time. I deserve so much better. I?ve been over qualified since the day I started working there. They don?t deserve me.",0,1556303424.0,bhpq6j,18,offmychest

 I was with this person for two years, I loved him and I would've do anything for him. He was my world. At first things were good, just a normal relationship. After the first year things changed I felt as if he was using me for sexual purposes. He'd never want to see me, we only went out about six times in our relationship (I did see him during school), he purposely would ignore my messages or calls, we'd argue and he'd promise to change and I would forgive him. He never changed. Things got more serious, we never had sex but we did do oral. But it just started to feel like that was all he wanted.

Then one day, I said I didn't want to do it today, I thought he understood, he said that that was okay. We were just kissing then he started to get a bit violent, he was grabbing me a lot harder, almost hurting me I guess. I knew it didn't feel right but I said nothing. What he did next is something I'll never forget, he grabbed my head and forced me on to him and forced me to, well I'm sure you can guess. We broke up not long after, he left me for some else. I was so broken, he just dropped me and then pretended like we never happened. Just left me whilst I was feeling so low. Later on, a few months the thought of what he did to me started to haunt me. Every night I go to bed and I remember what he did, I dream about him and what happened. Every day seeing him reminds me of what he did. Seeing how he doesn't have a care in the world about what he did and whats worse he knows what he did.

 I think what has also made it worse was the other day, I was walking near my school(during our week off) and I seen the bus he would get to school and it reminded me of him, I thought ""it would be funny if he just got off it"", I looked up from the ground and I seen him, I felt terrified, I'm not scared or threatened by him but just seeing him unexpectedly whilst I was alone brought everything back. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I just carried on walking and reliving ever moment again again.

He asked me why I made the appointment and I couldn't tell him, as I cant tell you.  It was a whim.

That's my optic nerve, swollen as all hell, forced further into my eye by intracranial pressure.  That pressure is caused by either a concussion (of which I've had 0), genetics (its equally swollen in both eyes so incredibly unlikely), meningitis (dont have that) or a brain tumor.

I'm in my senior year of college and have very bad anxiety. I have a very hard time making friends. Even getting a text gives me anxiety.

I forced myself to go to a video game club meeting because I felt unhappy about not having friends. I stood in a bathroom with my stomach in knots considering not going, but I went anyway. I unexpectedly hit it off with a group of people. He was one of those people.

I forced myself to go to the video game club Halloween event. Him and I were one of the very few people to actually wear costumes. We had a lot of fun together but also had fun separated with other people. The 4 people who wore costumes took a group photo and he put his arm around me in the picture.

We slowly but surely spent more time together. We would play games together in the computer lab on campus. We went to the music store to ""try out"" their instruments (I play bass and violin, he plays drums and piano). One day, we had coffee and as we left and went to the parking lot, he asked me if I would consider going out with him.

I honestly thought we were becoming good friends up until that point and I had no idea he had feelings for me. But after he said, that my brain basically broke. I stuttered something incoherent and covered my blushing face. After that night, I thought about him in an entirely different light. We went on a small road trip to the beach with our friends and I cuddled his jacket the entire trip (apparently he didn't notice!) 

After more time of us spending time together as friends, he asked me if I would consider a relationship with him. I said yes, and he told me how he had never even kissed a girl before. We watched the movie 'Sorry to Bother You' in an internet cafe while awkwardly cuddling the entire time. 

When he took me back to my house, we kissed, and I instinctively slipped a bit of tongue (oops), he really liked it and it ended up in a makeout session in his car. 

Fast forward, we are in a serious relationship and I am very much in love. He makes me laugh so hard. I am unbelievably attracted to him... Every time I see the little gap in his front teeth I fall in love all over again. I have been able to completely be myself with this man. He is so genuine.

We had a lot of good times and we helped each other but I was definitely the more mature of us even though he was a few years older and it wore on me. I didn?t feel like a girlfriend anymore. I felt like his mom.


I didn?t like it. I didn?t like how I couldn?t rely on him for the things I needed. Like when I went with him for a weekend away and the day we were supposed to leave, I asked him multiple times to leave and he just kept asking me to wait until he was done with his fantasy football pick and kept drawing it out for hours. I broke down in the car after we left and he blamed his friends rather than taking responsibility. And we both have generalized anxiety, so you?d think he?d pick up on things like that.


The last straw though. He was in my house when on a different floor, my family and I were having a dysfunctional time and my brother threatened to hit me because I accused him of being a hypocrite (I reference his past history for violence). My bf heard me yell ?you threaten to hit me again, I?m going to call the police? but he stayed upstairs.


He said that he didn?t want to make the situation worse and I told him I understood...but on the inside, I no longer felt safe with him. My bf who is a black belt in aikido, who should have been able to easily subdue a single aggressor in a safe manner. I have about a hundred pounds vs my sibling who is almost six feet tall and I don?t know how many pounds. 


When he failed to stand by my side when I needed him the most, I don?t know, I just began to wonder why I was with him. Yeah he?s a good person inside and sweet and texts me and says all the right things. Yet, when I explain to him what I need in a relationship, it doesn?t click with him, he says he doesn?t understand because he doesn?t have experience with that kind of thing.


Eventually I got sick of explaining in different ways and trying to find a solution together. He simply didn?t get it. Situational or social awareness. He didn?t seem autistic in the least, just immature and childish.


So fuck me for being honest and breaking up with him because I didn?t want to be with him anymore. 


Fuck me because he felt blindsided by it and somehow it?s my fault for not making him understand. 


Fuck me for going on tinder because I like sex and I don?t need a relationship to enjoy it.


Fuck me for finding a better connection with someone a couple weeks after breaking up with him.


How about fuck my ex?s friends for sending me spiteful messages about how they never liked or respected me and that they only put up with me because they cared about their friend and I seemed to make him happy.


Fuck them for being two faced and talking shit about my ex to me when we were still together.


Fuck them for calling me ?bat-shit crazy? when I never resorted to misogynistic name calling.


Fuck my ex who has friends that are extra venomous because they can?t have relationships that aren?t shallow and short lived.

I?m sorry that you both think it?s cool to sit on your high horses and tell other people they need to get their shit together.


No shit, that?s why I dumped your boy clueless and I count my blessings that I am neither one of you because it must be exhausting to hate yourselves so much that you need to take it out on other people.


He keeps telling me that MY NEEDS are so COMPLICATED and unusual. Then why did it take me a week and a half on tinder to find an adult that had zero issues with my supposedly special ?needs?? Maybe it?s the same reason why I?d never had an issue before. It?s not that complicated. You?re just simple, and the thing I hate most, which is willfully ignorant.

My life is oh so fucked, but I am still glad I?m not any of you. Also glad I don?t have to deal with you anymore because I blocked you on everything I remembered to block you on.

All my life I've always carried friendships. I'm always the one approaching people even if I have awful social skills. I'm always the one trying to keep long distance friendship a float. I'm always putting in 101% into a friendship. I guess it makes me look desperate in a way. I wish someone would try in a friendship I have with them. It's never mutual and is always one sided. I wish someone would want to get to know me or asked what I enjoyed or what my hobbies were. I feel like I'm a mystery and that nobody wants to get to know me as a person. I always feel like I have to try so so hard in friendships I'm always trying to get know others but nobody wants to know anything about me and then assume things about me. I always feel like nobody cares about my input.  We were put into a class project and everyone ignored my opinions and didn't even consider them and people just talked over me so I just gave up and left quiet. I wish someone would say ""hi"" to me. Or say ""hey what's up"" - nobody has ever done that. Nobody has ever asked me how I am. I can't imagine somebody wanting to be in a relationship with me to be honest. The thought of someone being attracted to me makes me laugh. I have such little confidence in myself.

I?m a F25 living by myself in a smalltown in Europe. Since I?ve been 13, i?ve been faking who I am online to get attention. 

Most of you probably think of the casual catfish luring people into relationships because they don?t like themselves. But that?s not true for me. I do like myself, to some limit. I don?t have problem finding partners and/or friends irl. Which makes what I do even more freaking weird.

It started when I was 13. The good old time with MSN. I don?t know why, but i lied to my irl friends about having friends that lived in in other towns. They showed interest in it, and I made a MSN accounts for them. Talked to my friends through these ?charachters?. I even kept my phone number to myself just so my friend could text with my made up friends at night. 

It escalated really quick. I made fake accounts on random sites and communities (often children sites, being 13-15 myself) claiming to be someone I wasn?t. It was always a guy. A guy I found attractive. People befriended me really quick and I stuck to it.

When I was 16, one IRL friend realized what was going on. She was closer to my ?character? than to me. And she told people the truth. I was hated in all communities. I?m not mad about this. I deserved it.

The weird thing is, you would think I would stop after this, right? Well, no. I just went to other communities. And the same thing happend over.. and over.. and over again.

Fast forward to today. Like I said, I?m 25. And I have 3 living ?chars? right now. I use different browsers to talk through them all on different discord servers.

I have this girl on my social media who went to high school with me and she suffers from a variety of health conditions with symptoms similar to mine. We weren?t close in HS but I have been talking to her for advice and confiding in her about how my chronic pain has taken over my life and I am only 22.

She proceeded to talk about how she finished her AA degree and was going to get a nursing degree next and nothing was going to stop her. She knows that I had to drop out of school and had to finish my degree online because I couldn?t cope with the pain, I had no treatment plan or diagnosis. She told me that I need to learn to deal with my pain better because she actually has an illness and she goes through life just fine. That made me feel so weak.

For those who called me an attention seeker: Stop invalidating people in need. I'm at a point in my life where I'm strong enough that such remarks have zero effect on me. But others who are still battling to find courage to reach out might read this post. They might be in a crucial and vulnerable turning point in their lives. They might find courage to seek help, right up to a point where someone just has to invalidate them as such. Those comments make them AFRAID to be invalidated again, to be called a liar again. They are afraid to be told to suck it up again. It silences victims seeking help because they fear to be just that: attention seekers, not people in real need. But they are people in need. People who suffered chronic trauma NEED HELP, compassion, empathy, acceptance. Not ridicule, further invalidation or judgement.

I WAS PISSED when I learned about that. what god damn ASSHOLE will do that to someone like her. She's now going to therapy and is not in a good place right now. I just really hope things get better for her.  


she did ask my friend about me, and how I was doing. So it makes me happy that she remember me at least...",0,1556354038.0,bhx3vc,1,offmychest
165,165,"So a couple months ago, I lost my malamute who was 15 years old. It was a heartbreaking, and soul crushing moment. I haven?t wanted to talk about it at all, even with my close friends or girlfriend. The first week after he passed. I lost a lot of sleep, it caused me to slip into a deep depression. I stopped caring about myself. I stopped caring about seeing anyone. I just locked myself in the room and kept quiet about my emotions. 

People checked up on me but I didn?t want to respond. I finally was able to pull myself out of this funk about a week ago after spending the weekend at my parents after I effectively damaged my quality of life by actively avoiding everything and everyone. Yesterday, my parents offered me some help with bills to help clean out their yard that hasn?t been touched in a couple years.

As I was raking the area he used to run around. I had caught my ankle in a little hole he must have dug. Upon digging a little deeper I noticed there were a few toys in the hole. I grabbed a rope and realized it was a play rope I got him 10 years ago. It hit me with a wave of happiness. I thought about all the times he would around so happy and energetic when I would want to play with him with the toy. All the good memories I had with that dog, why I considered him my best friend.

This small glimpse made me realize something, I kept focusing on the end of his life, I never took pictures of him when he was younger, so I never really had a direct path to those memories. It opened my eyes entirely and I think that shred of happiness I felt was enough to start the path of crawling out of this hole of depression.

TL;DR: dog died, I have been depressed until I found something to remind me of the good things about him instead of the end of his life. Starting today, been thinking of how to get my life back on track.",0,1556319006.0,bhsjih,6,offmychest
166,166,"So, I don't know if this is weird of me to feel or not because I can't logically understand why this bothers me so much. But basically, my bestie and I were talking about going to see Endgame together along with my roommate the other day. Then, on the premier night, apparently the two of them went to see it and didn't invite me. She did tell me that we would go see it together in a couple of days but for some reason I'm extraordinarily upset by not being there with her during her first viewing.

&#x200B;

Her logic on going was that she did plan on going to the midnight premier (11 PM is when they went due to it coming out earlier than Midnight) and that I stated I had to work early the next day and wouldn't want to do a midnight. Except what I said was that I would have to think about it if we went late because of work. Plus my roommate worked way earlier than me and still went. I wasn't even asked if I wanted to go which I really would have loved to do. I was sad about not being able to earlier in the day. Originally we actually were going to go on the premier night together but our roommate didn't realize what day it was and meant to plan for Sunday. So we were going to all go on Sunday instead. But my bestie got this spur of the moment desire to just go out and socialize and decided to go on the premier night after all and asked my roommate to join her.

I don't know if maybe I'm just being childish or what but something about this bothers me so much. I am extremely tempted to just go see it by myself now instead because I'm just so frustrated. That's not to say I won't go a second time with her but I feel as though I'm not sure that I want to have my first viewing be with her now. I can't really discuss this further with her because I've already brought it up a couple of times and she thinks I'm just looking for something to get angry at apparently. I'm not sure if this is because she thinks I'm ALWAYS looking for something to get angry at because it's my personality or something, or if it's because I'm just really stressed lately. But either way this does really bother me and I'm not sure I can bring it up again. I just want to know if anyone else understands how I'm feeling or can maybe put it into logic that I seem to be failing to.",0,1556353626.0,bhx2er,1,offmychest

It started off a beautiful June day. It was my grandfathers 80th birthday. My wife and our 2 daughters were getting in the car and my step father was mowing our lawn. We wave he smiles and waves back. We lived 3 houses apart from each other. So he would come mow our yard because landscaping was a passion of his.

We have an amazing time at the party its sunshine and a cool 80 degrees outside. We pack up say good bye to everybody my wife is yelling for me but I keep talking for a very long time. I just got caught up in conversation. 20 mins later we leave. 

She says I?ve been trying to leave for 30 mins. I smile and say lets grab a coffee. She smiles and agrees. We get coffee and head home. The sky is black rain and hail pour out of no where. Please believe every word I say because from here on out it sounds like a fictional thriller screenplay.

The storm lasts 3 mins. Now there is a double rainbow my wife and kids are in awe. Im thinking how odd for this to come and go so fast. We make it to our street. I say to my wife ?lets go see daryl and mom say thanks for mowing the yard.? As were nearing our house I see flashing lights in the distance. We live on a bend. I tell my wife to stop home so I can grab something  real quick. She says no somethings wrong. Im like just stop I gotta run in she says NO somethings wrong. 

We pull around the bend everything?s in slow motion I see a parked car on the side of the road. In the distance I see a ambulance then I see police cars. I look to my right I see daryl my step fathers motorcycle standing up in the middle of a field. I look down to the ground I see daryl face first in the ditch..... I gasp and scream DARYL my kids immediately scream my wife screams. Daryl is my second dad he?s been in my life for 24 years I?m 30 he?s my kids grandfather. 

We pull into the drive way my mom is inside sleeping off midnights. My kids run inside to tell her. My wife is like a chicken with her head cut off screaming and crying running from person to person. Everything is still in slow motion to me I walk over to the scene, the ambulance is just getting to him. The trooper says something to me I cant make it out but i know he?s trying to stop me from going over. I squeeze past him I get to daryl the paramedics roll him over, I see them reach in his groin for a pulse she shakes her head and they put a tarp over his body. I know immediately.

My mom wakes up she wont come off the porch shes passing out she knows He?s gone. One of the most haunting memories is her screaming whats he need? He needs my mom she says ?mooommmm help him please mom? her mom has been gone for 10 years. She passes back out. We all head to the hospital nobody knows he?s actually gone except me.

We arrive they pronounce him dead now we all head back home to grieve. Now all I?m thinking is how??? And why was his bike standing up in the middle of the field, if I was there before any medic or police actually made it to the scene then how could his bike be on the stand. Then I remember the one car parked it dawns they were the ones to call it in. 2 days go by were all at moms grieving together. This is where everything turns insane.

2 vehicles pull in front of my moms house and they are just parked in the road for 20 mins talking to each other. Im starting to get upset because this is very rude. The truck pulls off the suv pulls in to the drive way I see strangers get out and start walking towards me. Light bulb goes off, its the people who called the accident in. They come to the door and say can we talk to your mom we are the ones who found daryl. I say of course come in. She walks past and her boyfriend is next I lock eyes and I know him!! He?s a RAGING ALCOHOLIC!! The last time I saw him he threw another guy on the back of his motorcycle shit faced at 1am to go to the bar before it closes.

The first thing out of his mouth was ?We were heading to the store to get beer and we came across him? as he?s looking at the ground. Immediately I have the worst vibes I have ever felt in my life. I cant believe he just said that. They sit down and my mom thanks them gives her a hug. Conversation starts.

The woman starts asking questions immediately what was daryl doing? Was he a drinker? Did he drink that day? What did the police say? Wheres the motorcycle? Did the cops say how he crashed? She even goes to say when they pulled up they walked out to check on him and it looked like he was mad and threw his helmet and gloves!!! WTF!! She SAYS WE SAW HIM TAKE HIS LAST BREATH. As this woman is spewing her garbage I get a phone call from Daryl?s son he tells me daryl died on impact. So all this shit she is saying doesn?t even make any sense. Turns out they walked out in the field and PICKED DARYLS BIKE UP AND PUT IT ON ITS KICKSTAND!! Tampering with a accident scene grounds enough to at least be questioned about. My mom doesn?t pick up on anything. I?m just giving her the death stare because I know there lying and full of shit. She does ask one perfect question. Who were you guys talking to outside for awhile before you came in? ?Oh thats my friend James xxxxx?

Turns out I know that guy through another friend. He?s a dirtbag in and out of prison has 8 kids smokes weed while there on his lap real winner. Im thinking why the hell of all places would you guys see each other on this country road and converse for 20 mins in front of the family?s house of the man you just found dead. Fucking weird!!

I tell my mom I think they had something to do with the accident she starts crying and it all comes to her. Shes knows they were saying and asking weird shit. She just thought they were weird. When I tell her the autopsy says daryl died on impact she realizes that woman?s crazy. I need to get out of the house so I call a good buddy to pick me up and go for a ride and tell him everything.

He picks me up I tell him everything. I tell him how I found daryl and that these people showed up had a weird ass story yadda yadda. Then I go oh yea and they stopped in front of my moms and talked to James xxxxx for 20 mins before they even came in. He slams the breaks pulls the car over looks at me with tears in his eyes and says James was there today talking to the people who called Daryl?s accident in? I said ya. My friend says I saw James the evening of the accident he came to my house and asked if that was my step dad that died in the crash. He goes on to tell him he was there at the scene driving by and saw the body. My friend says dude why didn?t you stop and help. He said there was already cops there and somebody parked. He?s  full of shit I was the first one there after they found daryl the cops and ambulance pulled up 30 secs after I did. They immediately blocked the road off so no way he came after I did. That means he was there with the people who called it in and left the scene and they stayed. My head swells and I cant breath as it all comes together.

They are all friends and were going to a graduation party. They were either drunk or speeding and ran my dad off the road around the sharp bend in between our houses. He lost control and ran into a fence post and collapsed his aorta less then 100? from his drive way. They took my moms husband my daughters best friend. They took a piece of all of us and they tampered with the scene, they stood the bike up they touched everything. They came the next day to my moms to get their story straight and find out what the cops know.

I call the cops tell them all of this and they send ONE cop to talk to me. He agrees this is crazy and he will find out whats going on. He calls me back the next day and says there all lying about everything. He says some of them say they know each other, some say they don?t, some say there friends and some say they never heard of each other. The cop tells me they have them on multiple lies and next stage is to bring them down for questioning he says were on to something big and he will call me the second he knows anything. The cop talked to James and he admits to driving by the scene. Were all feeling a little bit better. 

Days go by no call. I call the officer he never answers me. I leave messages nothing. Days turn to weeks. Weeks turn to months. I call and the only officer who was working my case was now transferred and theres a new investigator taking over the case. He calls my mom and says the cause of the accident is a inexperienced motorcyclist and the case is closed...... 

This June 24th will be 2 years since daryl died 100ft away from his driveway. The last time we saw him he waved smiled and mowed my yard. I think about the accident every day and I?m sure I should be in some kind of therapy. I think what if non stop, what if I woulda left the party when my wife wanted to. What if i woulda thanked him that 2 sec diff could of changed everything. My mom needs therapy for sure. She is not moving on or letting anything go she is in pain everyday. So are my wife and kids and I have to see these people around town knowing what they did. Sorry to bring anybody down I just need to get this out and off my chest. Maybe they didn?t do anything but in my heart of hearts I know they did something and got away with it all. RIP Daryl.

For the past two weeks my uncle, 62 years of age, has been incredibly sad, quiet, and irritable. My aunt said he?d come home in tears one day. This is highly unusual as he?s normally the sweetest, happiest, most energetic person in our extended family. We all kept asking what was wrong, but he just blew us off with ?oh it?s nothing, just the weather?. Finally, yesterday, he revealed to my aunt what had happened, and she passed the story to us.

Seems he?d gone into a coffee shop where a ?young women?, as he put it, was working: so likely a teenager or early 20?s. As he paid for his coffee he told the young women that she was very pretty. He?s not at all sleazy, he just genuinely likes making people happy. As he began walking out of the shop the women went around the corner to her friends. She?d assumed he was gone, but my uncle overheard her say something like ?ewwww, this creepy old bald guy just hit on me! God what a creep. I hope he doesn?t come back to rape me!? Then they all started laughing. My uncle said he quickly left the shop, dropping the coffee on the floor on the way out. 

I know he?ll bounce back from this, but to me this women?s words and actions are unfathomable.  I see this type of behavior in other instances too, specifically the phrase ?creepy old guy?. Yes, there ARE legitimately creepy men, HOWEVER, the standard by which most ?creepiness? is gauged seems to be age and baldness. I?ve seen many social media posts about this, heard girls use the term for when an ?older guy? hit on them. You even see it in sitcoms and movies. There?s always the joke about the ?creepy old guy? from the bar who tried to buy me a drink *laugh track*. 

Why is this accepted? If men should treat women with respect and kindness (and they should), why aren?t men given the same consideration? Is it because men don?t have feelings, and should be able to handle it? Can you imagine an instance where a 62 year old women told a young man he was handsome, and he went on to tell his friends ?ewww, this creepy old hag hit on me. She probably wants my dick!?

178,178,"I feel how I did when I was a kid: in my own head and on my own. I spent a year and a half liking one girl. I never knew if she liked me back. I didn't make any moves. Next thing I know she falls head over heels for a guy she met less than a week ago on a school trip in late March. As of today, they're officially dating. I don't know what I did wrong, if anything. We used to have such a good time together, I'd make her laugh, she'd make me laugh, staring at each other, stuff like that. All that changed last week. Over the trip in March I'd asked her to prom to see if she had some semblance of affection for me, but almost immediately after the promposal she said she felt nauseous and went inside. I went to take a shower, and when I came out, I found her and her soon to be boyfriend talking in the hotel room. She left once I got out to take her shower in her hotel room. At this point I had already come to the realization that she probably didn't like me, because she had ignored me and even her best friend for him after the second day of the trip for the most part. If she could talk to anyone, she'd always choose him. Fast forward to last week with prom that Saturday. Our practice ended, and I was talking to her afterwards. I knew from the start something was up, because she never hung around long, and she said she was waiting for a friend. I guessed one of her girl friends, and she said yes, but I knew she was lying. I leave and as I'm getting in my car to pull out of the parking lot, I see him walking to the pavilion. Of course it's him. Over the next few days she's always talking to him after school, which is what we'd normally do. She also said one day as we were talking that she had to go home, but all she did was walk 20 feet over to him to talk. At this point I decided to tell her I wanted to cancel my promposal and we could go separately, and ever since prom night we haven't spoken. It's been a week of no words, and I sit next to her in class. I just don't know if I did something wrong, wasted my time, misinterpreted anything, or was just never a thought in her head. And I just can't understand how someone she didn't know up until the trip became her only interest so quickly. She had never dated, he had never dated, and I have never dated. We were on a pretty level playing field, but she chose him. On the bright side, even though this situation sucks, I have actually been happy throughout it because for the first time in years I've actually been consistently happy. That happiness came from her, and being in pursuit of someone. Up until her I hadn't liked anyone really, but she struck something in me. Throughout my time with her I learned to overcome my anxiety, and actually enjoy myself because I could connect with someone who wasn't one of my guy friends. There was hope, and I guess the reason I didn't make any moves was because I was addicted to the feeling of a possible love that I didn't want to be shattered.

I lost my very best friend because I couldn't take how abusive he was. Speaking out against him, he'd rally everyone around him to back him up, when he was the one causing harm in the first place. I got scared to even disagree with him; so I stopped talking about what bothered me. I know this happened in childhood but I vividly remember it; we disagreed on something and he struck me as hard as he could in the back. There was a bruise on my back for weeks, and I never showed my parents. Never.

I remembered that, and it trained me to never tell him how I felt. Once you've been hit by someone, or at least in my case, you never trust them again.

I will sometimes drive to a 24 hour store and just walk around because I don?t want to be alone, and my boyfriend (20M) works late nights often (he works from 5:30pm today until 4am, at a movie theater). I went to therapy because my boyfriend suggested it due to my constant suicidal thoughts and they had me start taking seroquel after I brought up what happens at night. I hear things like pounding, voices, footsteps, doors, creaking, breathing, etc. and see shadows and figures. I try to avoid reflective surfaces because my own movement scares me. I keep my back turned to walls and look at the ceiling and corners when entering rooms. I don?t like closed doors because I don?t know what?s behind it, but I don?t like open doors because I fear something could easily jump out of them. My therapist asked me to concentrate on the things I saw and write about it as it happened. I did. It was the worst suggestion possible, with good intentions. I say in a corner with a knife in hand crying and eventually ran outside screaming. I love in an apartment complex but apparently no one heard me (or cared).

192,192,"I have a lot to unpack. 

I spent the last 10 years building up a profile and portfolio to join the industry as a level designer. I went through various universities, moved into a new city *twice*, got a bachelor, a post graduate specialized diploma (basically a master) to get as much tools and knowledge as I could to offer a very complete and convincing profile.

I went through numerous extreme stressful situations, including battling a depression midway, but the thought of joining the industry was keeping me afloat. I always tried to outdo myself and do everything in my power to be on point and deliver quality work and god knows how many obstacles I've met on my path.

Last year was among the most important year of my journey since it was a school directly in contact and handled by the industry. I loved every moment of it, from the students, the teachers, the courses, the homeworks, it was an incredible and fun experience and I felt at my place. The last three months of that school year is focused on doing a full-scale production of 30 people of a video game. Turns out people trusted me enough to put me in charge of being an assistant lead game designer for the game (they voted for it and I was offered in return). Not only that but as we started production we got a mail from one of our teacher who worked directly at one of my city's big studio: they wanted to hire three junior level designers.

 Not only that but the description of the ideal candidate was exactly on point with mine, students at school even assumed I was a guaranteed bet because of that. And I also had a mentor/friend who was a senior there directly as an inside contact to push my profile forward.

Everything was going fine and I was on cloud 9.

Nope.

The studio in question decided to go for three candidates that not only hardly had any experience but didn't have any portfolio. One of them actually rushed a quick project *the weekend before his interview*, a person who is extremely friendly but never really did any convincing level designer work at school imo. All three of them got the job instantly.

My profile was ignored. It was very painful... Because I felt all my work was for nothing or that I wasn't taken because there was something problematic with my profile. It must be. I tried to stay optimistic. Because nothing happens for a reason right? 

A few weeks later, an indie studio I worked for 9 months as a level artist was looking for a junior level designer. A studio I loved. Maybe now was my time? They asked me to do a level design/level art test... with the assets I already used when I worked for them (????), so I went through the whole hiring process again (????) only to see a graduate in cinema get the job as a junior level designer, without any experience. Great, another stab in the stomach. 

... And then at the same time, another subdivision of the aforementioned big studio but in another city started to hire level designers. I applied. I got an answer in three days. They said they had good feedbacks from the school (then why you ignored my profile at the very beginning?) and made me go through an exhaustive (but fun) test. Did it, had an interview. It was probably the best interview in my life, lasted 1h20 at least. I wasn't stressed, no question blocked me, I was able to give complete constructive answers to everything, even make them laugh. I was ready to move to a different city and leave all my 6 years friend/life behind *for them*. But it wasn't enough, *again*.

I was called the next week by a human resource person that **wasn't even present during my interview**. He said that apparently ""they felt my answers about the role of a level designer were too vague and preferred to not pursue"". My insider contact did his researches and it turns out I didn't have enough experience despite having as much as another person who was hired recently for the same role.  Either way I was told bullshit and I was denied despite having what was needed overall, if not more than many people who get hired there.

And that was the last time I was given an opportunity for an interview. That was October 2018.

I kept sending applications after applications, I'm reaching the 40th one, but I'm constantly ignored. My profile hasn't progressed or evolved since and I'm out of options. I see job offers (from studio I already applied thrice in the last year) that correspond to things I can perfectly do but that's never enough, not to attract the attention of HRs. I see people around me with less experience and less difficulty gets opportunities. I see people with more skills than me struggle. 

And that's how it is. And  **it sucks hard**. I don't feel like effort and skills are rewarded. I sure as hell don't feel like all I've done is being recognized or acknowledged. I feel like I spent all these efforts for an industry that give jobs to people who are at the right place at the right time, or did the right smiles, or knew the right person, but nothing really beyond these spheres.

I'm mad and angry all the time, and now depressed again, because my motivation is crushed. I went on this journey *to be* part of the industry, not to *hope to be*. I could still be trying in one year, if not more, and still  be left out.

I deserved the first opportunity in that big studio, I *should have had it*. But I've been ignored, lied to, and I still don't know today why.

I'm constantly scared, anxious, terrified that I'm just one of these person that will never make it, despite all I've done, and I just want to scream at them but I can't... And I'm so mad and exhausted and it's taking so long to get something that I'm out of juice. I'm not even sure I would be happy to have an opportunity tomorrow because of how much of a hassle it all turned out to be.

And I'm expected to stay optimistic and do personal projects on my side while I get a temporary boring job with the hope that... *maybe*, a big *maybe* life will change for the better and I'm going to be recognized? That's not the life I worked for, nor the life I want... And with my currently fragile mind I'm not sure I would handle this in the long run.

 If I wasn't able to get a free job when I had contacts, the highest grades in the school's history, a complete and diverse portfolio, recommendations, skills, how am I supposed to assume I can someday make it the normal and tough way?

193,193,"So let's go back a few months. Around Christmas and New Years, my brother J proposed to his girlfriend JH for two years, bought a husky puppy together, and made a plan to move out of their apartments into a rented house in a state over from mine until they get married.

194,194,"I posted this two years ago. I have been thinking about this for a while. A bunch of people asked if I was/suggested that this shows that I am a natural submissive. I have finally admitted to myself that I am. I don't practice anything of the sort (and am not interested in doing so) but I definitely am. Anyways, here is the story. I want to get it off my chest again.

""May I please bring you your coffee, Mr. Kravitz, Sir?""

I could see the form of a smirk on his bearded face. He leaned back and nodded, before going back to grading his papers. I eagerly ran off to the faculty break room and set the coffee before him.

He then looked up at me and gave me a file.

""Go place these in all of the social studies faculty mailboxes."" He then leaned back in his big chair, one leg folded over the other. ""I have to say. It's such a wonderful turn of events to see you... listening... to me so carefully.""

My heart pounded. I had such a giant energy taken over my body. I was serving and pleasing Mr. Kravitz, and it was all I wanted to do.

This was a very unlikely turn of events. I was a senior in high school. (It was the mid-90s). I was an underachieving, free-spirited class clown. I was not a bad kid -- too nerdy for that, even though I was really into punk music and hung out with skaters. But I was very sarcastic. I also knew how smart I was and had a certain arrogance about myself, despite my crappy grades.

Mr. Kravitz was my political science teacher, as well as the chair of the social studies department. He was exactly what you would think from an administrator. Cold. Unfeeling. Strict. By the book. I went to a public school without any real dress code. Mr. Kravitz was the only teacher who wore a suit. He was exactly everything I mocked and made fun of.

Even though I am absolutely not anymore, at the time I fancied myself a Young Republican. Mr. Kravitz, despite appearances, was a staunch Democrat and a huge Bill Clinton fan. I was very outspoken in class anytime we debated. He was not afraid to express his opinions. I wasn't, either. And I was also obnoxious enough to cut into him, interrupt, etc. (As I did with plenty of other teachers.) Our debates were NOT friendly at all. At one point he said that there was nothing he wanted more than to turn me into a liberal.

I also did not do a lot of homework -- for any teacher. For his class, we had a weekly assignment. We had to find a political news story and write 2-3 pages on its importance and tie it back into class. ""Mr. X. I see you haven't done your assignment. Again."" I said something back to him along the lines of, ""I don't waste my time on nonsense"" incredibly rudely.

The next day, I was told to go to the guidance office. Mr. Kravitz was there, stern looking. So was my guidance counselor. And my mom (my parents were really involved in my life) was on a speaker phone. He told her what I said. She was incredibly upset. And my punishment for my remarks? Every day for a week, I was going to report to Mr. Kravitz's office after class and ""help"" him as his assistant. My mom agreed to that.

I was really mad the first day I entered his office. His back was to me, even though he knew I arrived. He spun to me. ""Ah. I see that you at least know how to arrive on time. I'd like a glass of water. Be quick. No talking to your friends. I expect you back in three minutes.""

It was these sorts of trivial, mundane tasks and errands. I got him his coffee. I filed. I stapled. I cleaned his desk. Or I'd have to stand by patiently as he talked to another teacher or the like. If I looked away or slouched, he'd snap at me to pay attention while I waited. Mostly, it was silence. But sometimes he would say something to me about how I wasn't living up to my potential, I wasn't as unique as I thought I was, etc.

Finally, a few days into the punishment, he had me place a few files on his desk. I was across from him. He stood up and put on his suit jacket. ""You are really too big for your britches and you really need to be humbled. I hope you realize this and are coming to terms with it.""

He got up and walked past me, paying me no mind. But as he breezed past me, there was this wave of energy that overcame me. I had never felt more alive or awake. And my brain said something that it never said before.

""You must obey Mr. Kravitz."" I just felt this... purpose. That the only purpose in my life was to please him. My heart was pounding. I had this weird anxious feeling. This thought took over my life.

Those weekly assignments we had were 2-3 pages. They could even be handwritten since not everyone had a home computer yet. The next time I had the assignment, I wrote about 10 pages. The margins were perfect. I placed it into a plastic binder. I had such a huge rush while I was writing and preparing it.

I had such an excitement and sense of dread as class began. He called each of us one-by-one to hand in our assignments. I gulped as I stood up and gave it to him. He wasn't looking but I could tell he was shocked to feel the plastic in his hands, along with the few extra pages, along with my name being attached. Then he saw it and had a crooked, smug smile.

""Well, well, well. Will you look at this? Learning your lesson, I see."" He held it up and looked at it with this sarcastic face that he was ""impressed."" He pretended to read it. ""So many pages."" A bunch of my classmates were chuckling at me and my work. Not even the lamest honors students turned in anything that overboard.

All of my assignments for his class were turned in along those lines. I just had such a heightened energy anytime I did work for his class and just this excitement when I would see the glint in his eyes knowing that I was doing the work as he intended. (And I had great grades on them, too.)

And then, the next day, I knew there was something else I needed to do.

School ended. I waited a few minutes for the buzz of the day to end. Mr. Kravitz was behind his desk, going over some work. I knocked on the door. He looked up and and offered me a hello. After a few seconds of small talk, I told him why I was there. I stood before him, with my hands folded.

""Mr. Kravitz, Sir. I came to ask if you needed an assistant.""

He chuckled a bit and then sat back in his chair again, peering over his glasses at me. I was shaking almost.

""And why is that?"" He had this inflection not just of curiosity. But he wanted to make me say it.

""Ever since that week, I've been doing so much better in school."" I paused. I took a deep breath. ""You were right. I needed to be humbled, Mr. Kravitz, Sir.""

He just stared for a second and then had a wicked grin and then a laugh. He agreed and nodded.

And that's when I asked if I could fetch him his coffee.

A few weeks went by. I dutifully completed all of his assignments. And I arrived at his office promptly after school. I brought him his coffee. His water. I did all of his filing and copying requests. Sorting. My classmates were either in a club or goofing off while I was busy asking a custodian for baby wipes so I could wipe off his desk for him.

The day ended the same. It would be close to 4. He would announce it was time to leave. I would get his briefcase for him. I would have sorted out what he needed for the night -- papers to be graded and the like -- and have them properly filed. I would then carry his briefcase for him, walk behind him, hold the door open for him, and carry his briefcase to his car for him. I learned to laugh at his corny jokes.

My assignments continued to be delivered as I had met them. In class, I stayed quiet. I stayed away from much of the debates in class and absolutely did not challenge Mr. Kravitz.

Finally, near the end of the school year, we had some debate about health care policy. As it worked in this class, he usually sat in the back while we would take turns to address the class. I raised my hand high in the air -- like I would in the beginning of the year to usually undermine him.

I got up and walked to the front of the room. Time felt like it stopped.

""Health care is a right. It is something the government should provide for its citizens, like they do in Scandanavia.""

I saw him trying not to crack a smile. ""This is a surprise from you,"" he said.

That feeling I had was so strong. I just turned by back on my beliefs in front of the entire class.

""Well, Mr. Kravitz, Sir. You convinced me."" I gulped. ""You turned me into a liberal.""

There were a few snickers in the classroom (I doubt anyone really cared, though). He said something very middle-of-the-road about the importance of keeping an open mind. There was no gloating or anything in front of the room.

But I went to this office. He was sitting behind the desk waiting for me. He had his hands steepled and had a kingly posture.

""Is it true? Did I make you see the err of your ways?""

I paused. I took a deep breath.

""Yes, Mr. Kravitz, Sir. You made me a liberal. You are by far the best teacher I have ever had in my life. You will be the best teacher I will ever have in my life. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me, Mr. Kravitz, Sir.""

He had this gigantic smirk. In the moment, I realized that I was bent completely to his will. He knew it, too.

""I wanted you to learn to respect authority. To respect my authority. Like I said. You needed to be humbled. You learned your lesson quite well."" He paused. ""Could you please go and bring me a Coke from the vending machine upstairs and an everything bagel from the break room with some cream cheese?""

I was sexually assaulted 7ish years ago. I just turned 29 on Easter. 

The emotions I never processed flooded back to me about a month ago. I got distracted because I had to move houses but now I'm back to feeling my feelings about it.

I just wanted to ramble. Here felt good for the time being.  

I'm upset. I've googled for support groups where I'm located (a pretty big city, lots of addiction resources) and just -- nothin. I went thru substance abuse recovery here and they have a bajillion meetings a day.

But anything to do with sexual assault is all $30-50/session and I just cant afford that

Maybe I'll start one. I dunno how to heal this shit tho. Talking about it helps. Writing does too. Crying does. But no scripts, nothing but cliches work right now ""one day at a time"" ""time heals all"" ""its okay to not be okay"" ---- I need to know I'm not alone. It cant be online though. It's not the same connection. 

What are other things I'd like to say

How about ""fuck that guy"". Lol 
Fuck his dumbass piece of shit life

Fuck him and his inability to control himself

Fuck you, I hope that your life is haunted with the memory of knowing you're a piece of shit human being every second of every day


I also fucking hate myself because I forgive you

I know a part of me doesnt care anymore because it could have been worse. And it's a weird feeling to know that you traumatized me enough to lose trust in myself but not humanity. And that I dont think I'm a victim nor survivor.

Fuck you for being confusing 

What else?
I was told not to minimize the trauma, but I can't help it. It didnt destroy my life, or maybe it did. I went thru hell these last 2 years and could blame you, but what the fuck good would that actually do? Give you more power?

Nah. The best way to take my power back is to give you silence. Your name is dead. Your power is dead. But imma tell people what happened 

I'm gonna tell people that 98% of the people I've met in my life are wonderful and then like 2% have been pure fucking evil and sometimes those pieces of shit force their own demons on you in some sort of abusive way and what you get to do as a purveyor of good is to learn how to channel those demons that have latched on to you as healing powers. How the fuck do you do that? Idk. 

I get creative. I write a lot. I talk a lot too. I should make a shirt that says ""ASK ME ABOUT MY SEXUAL ASSAULT, IT HELPS ME HEAL""

I own this experience now. You took away my power but now its mine to do whatever the fuck I want with it.

207,207,"Brief story- Alcoholism and drug addiction runs in both my mom and my dads side of the family, I am currently 21, and I have been addicted to drugs since I was 18. I am aware that if I am asking whether or not I am on the road to alcoholism, more likely than not, I am, but I just need to vent. I used to hate alcohol due to the hangover and the disgusting after effects I would receive, BUT I love the confidence it gives me and how it allows me to open up to everyone in ways I cannot currently do when I am sober (though I do intend to work on that). I have taken pretty much every major drug at least once (heroin, coke, meth, benzos, and a shit load of psychedelics and other rcs that I cannot recall) but my true love was always benzos, specifically Xanax. I suffer from crippling anxiety which leaves me feeling like an alien around other people and I rarely even leave my house (aside from work and hanging out with my amazing, loving, and most importantly, sober girlfriend) which probably doesn't help either. The few times I do go out for recreational purposes, i almost always have to consume drugs of some sort and I have only been sober for maybe less than 2 weeks ever since January 1st of this year (though, most of it has been Marijuana along with the rare prescription pills). Lately (especially this past week and a half) I have been drinking almost every single night (after work), which is something I would have never done, even 6 months ago, but since I am trying to maintain this image of a new ""sober"" me, I have resorted to alcohol because it is socially acceptable, I live with my family, and most importantly, it gives me that cocky and confident attitude that benzos give me (with the only difference being that my sleep is poor and I get shitty hangovers). This past week, I have been drinking on an almost compulsive level, even when i'm working (i'll go sneak a couple beers in while on lunch..) and honestly, I feel disgusted with myself. I can feel myself slipping back to my old ways and even now, as I speak, I am on nearly 100mg of Ritalin and half a fifth of alcohol into my night, by myself. I cannot afford rehab right now because I am only 1 year away from graduating college and I have no desire to go back to rehab (I have gone nearly a dozen times already). What kills me the most is that I come from a relatively upper-middle class family that is also very supportive of me, I have zero debt, and I have a girlfriend who has stuck by my side for almost 2 years even though I have been high for half of our relationship. I know I am ranting, but I just needed to vent about this to someone, anyone really, I know I have it in me to quit, but I hate who I am while I am sober. If your reading this and have confidence/mental health issues, take this as a warning to not get into drugs (this includes alcohol too because it is also a drug and I hate how it isn't considered one) as they only lead to one of  three endings, either death, prison, or eventually becoming sober and trying to fix the ruin you will inevitably leave behind in your life due to your addiction.",0,1556332246.0,bhul74,2,offmychest

212,212,"So everything started going downhill 2 years ago when my dad died of leukemia. He was admitted to the hospital literally a month before university started. 

I had to leave for university after 3 weeks, because I needed a week to get acquainted and because my university is overseas. During that week, I started getting intense flashes of fear, thinking about whether my dad would die. I would call my parents every day, wanting to be with my dad but trusting that he would survive and be alright. 5 days into the first week my mom started saying that my dad couldn't come to he phone because chemo made him tired, but she'd put my on speaker so my dad could hear me.

2 days before he died, my mother called me in the middle of the night, hysterical and in tears, telling me I had to come back immediately. I hopped on the next available flight. My dad had suffered a massive intracranial bleed, and had to be intubated just so he could breathe. He was so badly paralysed that the only thing he would do was grind his teeth and jerk the right side of his body. He couldn't seem to close his eyes. He was so badly bloated. I couldn't believe that he was actually my lively, active dad. When I left the room the first time, I remember thinking ""that man is not my dad"".

The doctors said they'd given him multiple bags of platelets but his numbers weren't rising. They couldn't wheel him in for an MRI to see how bad the stroke was because he needed the breathing apparatuses. I was in denial. I wanted my dad to be okay. My dad died 9 days into my first semester of university. I was in the ICU at his bedside and watched as the numbers on his screen fell. I felt so helpless. 

I went back to university about a week or two after his funeral. I began experiencing intense flashbacks to the ICU at any point in my day. My tutor in a workshop played a video of a baby with whooping cough, and the sound of the ""lack of O2"" alarm made my stomach drop. The flashbacks faded in time, but I began experiencing heart palpitations and the distinct sense that my heart was skipping beats. I went to the university doctor and she got me an EKG, but I was fine, thankfully. That was first year. 

Second year was fine, but I was so angry and unhappy all the time. My relationship with my mom has been weirdly distant yet affectionate for a long time. I think I've been holding a grudge against her, because she will only initiate a call to me once in a blue moon, and sometimes when I text her asking if I can call her, she leaves me on read and never responds until the next time I text asking if I can call. I've told her that it would be nice if she could respond to my texts, when if it's hours after she's read it, like ""oh sorry I didn't respond because I was suddenly busy and I forgot"", but it never happens. I think sometime in the last year I got worried that she's annoyed that I want to talk so much. 

Which brings us to now, my third year. I'm losing it. I've been feeling lost and kind of empty. I'm losing the motivation to leave my room, but thankfully I'm still keeping up with personal hygiene. I force myself to go to the library to study, but I'm getting tired easily. The entire day I'm just tired, even if I've had coffee. I should go see a doctor, huh.

Easter Sunday I had a strange, fearful and intense feeling that swept through my body when I woke up to use the bathroom, and lay down to go back to sleep, and I suddenly had a strange fear that I was having a heart attack, even though I didn't have any symptoms at all. Is this a panic attack?? 

That brings us to today. It's 6.25 am. I've been awake the entire night. I keep getting that panicky, terrifying feeling that my heart has stopped, every time I'm just about to drop off to sleep. That's if I can even get to that point. My body is exhausted, but I can't get my mind to stop. I've been awake the entire night. I went for a 20 minute walk at 4.30am. I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I tried going back to sleep just now, but I got that panicky feeling again when I was just about to fall asleep. I'm sitting on the floor, away from my bed right now. I don't want to associate my bed with that panic.

219,219,"So when I was in high school, me and my friends were your stereotypical douchebag bullies. We'd be rowdy in class, throw stuff at other people, hit on hot babes, pick on the shy or quiet kids by calling them mean nicknames, steal people's lunches, you name it. Sometimes it lead to a fight, most of the time it didn't. Me and my friends were on the baseball team so we thought we were the untouchable hot shots since we won the championship for our school three years in a row. That's pretty much how things went.

And I honestly didn't even come from a bad family. I came from a wealthy one actually. Neither of my parents abused me and I lived in a good neighborhood. I just had this cocky disposition that just became a part of me starting in probably middle school. But I didn't really think I was getting to anyone. It was just pure asshole-ness fun, in my opinion. That was until I found out some kid tried to hang himself in my senior year because one of my other friends had been picking on him the most because he had been caught making out with his gf and beat him bloody. I knew nothing about it but was still shocked when I heard about it. That's when I toned down on the shenanigans. I stopped talking with that friend after that and he's now in prison for armed robbery.

As for me, I dropped out of college my first semester because I didn't like being away from home for so long. After working shit jobs for a while, I saved up and went to the local technical school and am working on becoming an electrician. I also have picked up a hobby in assembling computers and some programming. And I met a nice girl on Tinder who's in school to become a vet. So things are going okay.

Anyway, I was down at the gas station on Monday and pulled up to the pump. I look over and see this one kid who I really picked on a lot. He was your stereotypical nerd who was one of the smartest in the class and would read comics at lunch and was on the chess team. He got accepted into MIT I found out. I would do stuff like throw him into his locker, take his backpack and dump its contents on his head, tell him to buy me lunch if I forgot my own money (or because I just felt like it), etc. I didn't even realize it was the same person at first. I walk over to him and introduce myself and he gives me an ""Oh. You"" look before he finally acknowledged me. I asked him how he was and he gave me basically one-word answers and I knew he didn't want me around. So I slowly began to apologize for all the shit I did to him and he still was kind of standoff-ish.

But we talked for a little while longer and eventually I think he took a chance and accepted my offer to buy him a drink at the bar next door. We talked for about an hour, asking how he's been and all that. He actually just finished his undergrad last year and is working at IBM. I told him I was happy for him and I think he slowly began to trust me a bit and knew I was being sincere. I actually found out that we live in the same apartment complex just a building apart. What a coincidence! Anyway, we each gave our contact info just in case we wanted to hang out again. And he got the bright idea of reaching out to other students on social media just to apologize to them as well.

I was quite extroverted and social as a young kid, I had a ton of friends and was often engaging in some sort of social activity. When I was around nine or ten, I moved to a new country. Over there, I had no friends and started to appreciate being on my own a lot more, just because of how often I was on my own.  Prior to this, I was usually always with someone, was only really on my own for short periods of time, and therefore assumed being alone would be bad. At first, I still wanted friends, but wanted to be on my own for the most part. As time went on, I started to make friends and over time they'd bore me or annoy me, and I'd stop being friends with them. I was introverted, but still wanted a social life, but I was bullied and ostracized. I often felt very lonely and depressed due to this. Beyond a point, I realized that I really don't get any enjoyment out of any of my relationships with other people. At this point I realized that I didn't really want any friends or relationships at all. I was very quiet for the most part, only talking when the teacher called on me or during presentations. For the most part, I ignored a vast majority of people, even when they were simply just saying Hi or something. During breaks (and even in class tbh), I'd just be fooling around on my own or reading a book. I did not feel any desire to have a relationship with my parents either, but I still talked to them out of obligation. After a while, I started to become really apathetic and disconnected from other people. I didn't really feel that much emotion, mostly just amusement or pride, and mild anger or frustration at times, although it was very fleeting. I became extremely apathetic, to the point where I didn't really feel fear anymore because I didn't care. I felt a major disconnect from everyone else, and although I always had trouble with emotion it just got heightened here. I wasn't completely bad socially, but I still did not really know how to deal with emotional situations and would feel nothing when people cried or someone died. For a long time I tried to convince myself that I did care, and did feel bad but I eventually realized that it's only logical to accept the truth and move on. For a long time I would get into a lot of trouble, but for the most part in high school I generally had good grades and did a few good extracurriculars so my parents did not mind and let me live my life. However, later on my parents starting complaining about how I had no friends and how I should be spending time with them now, as these will be the most fun years of my life. I decided to try once more, and now I just got more disconnected from people. Observing people socially, they really confused me. A lot of them couldn't tolerate others opinions and got mad at genuine criticism. They would react so stronlgy to praise and insult, and those did not affect me at all, so I started to view them as insecure pricks who needed validation. It became very easy for me to look down on the dumb, boring, unfunny, mainstream. I made a few 'friends' who were mostly like me, but we barely talked. We'd just do dumb and funny stuff together. I started to talk more, but mainly just to make sarcastic comments or to annoy people. With my general boredom in life, I craved the novel and exuberant things, so I decided to work hard in life so I would succeed as an adult. I came to terms with the fact that I would have to socialize to make good money, so I decided that I would talk to people at work but avoid them in my personal life. Again, continuing with my boredom, I became a massive adrenaline junkie just doing things for the thrill of them. Games, weed, the stupid yet funny shit I did, and my adrenaline inducing activities were the only things in life that really brought me joy. I did enjoy coding, science, and math too, but I wouldn't really do them in my free time to give me that thrill I craved. I found it ironic that I went from being so lonely to so happy on my own, but whatever. After I started to alleviate the boredom, I was and still am genuinely happy with my life and therefore felt no need to change it. When college started, I had to be social. There was no way around it, and I guess it would be the same way with work so I decided to try to an extent but mostly keep to myself. As I've said before, I'm really not that bad socially, most people think of me as funny, relaxed, and quiet. I still am very blunt and direct though. A lot of my friends started to date and have sex, but it really didn't interest me at all. If I felt any sexual urge, I'd masturbate but I felt no need to do it with another person if I could just masturbate to someone hot on my screen. And yeah that's about all there is to it. 

I don't really know why I made this post. Generally I don't really feel a need to 'get things off my chest'. Despite my asocial tendencies I do enjoy places like reddit and youtube and scroll them often without necessarily interacting with people (other than leaving sarcastic comments), and I've seen offmychest and found some of the confessions funny but again, I'd never expect myself to post here. I've never wanted a therapist for my 'issues' (I guess they're technically issues but I'm happy and it doesn't impact my productivity so who cares) because of what I said in the parentheses and also because not only do I not want to express my emotions and private thoughts, but also because I don't really feel a need to tell others stuff like this.

We were extremely close and I always felt like she was the only person in my family I could talk to that would understand. She was the only person that cared more about me and my happiness than family reputation.

I went back to her and asked ?Why are you lying to me? You?re not real. Are you here to let me say goodbye?? And she didn?t say anything but I hugged her and cried (still in the dream). 

It was a very long hug and we fell to the ground hugging and it was so vivid like I could feel my hands running through her hair but I didn?t feel like it was real. I felt all the physical feelings of the hug just none of the emotions that usually accompany the hugs she used to give me. Then she said something along the lines of okay times up or you?ve had your moment or whatever and I could feel the life slipping out of her again and then she died again on top of me in my arms.

I don?t think that was her spirit coming to visit me in my dreams cuz something about the energy was very off.

Basically, I work full-time and split house work with my sister-in-law, who lives in the same property as my husband and I. She has three kids and she smokes a lot of weed. I have a two hour commute to work, then two hours home, so I?m very exhausted by the end of the day. My sister-in-law does nothing at home, and she has started leaving all of her housework for me to pick up. I?ve tried confronting her about it, but she says I don?t understand exhaustion and won?t until I have my own kids. Now she locked yourself in her room when I?m home and pretend to be asleep so that she doesn?t have to see me. I?m too tired to try to do anything about it anymore. I fucking give up. My husband, who I love a lot, is absolutely terrified of confrontation, and will not help me out with the situation at all.  I know that he loves me, but right now I feel like he doesn?t think it?s worth it to go out of his comfort zone and help me. He would help with housework if he could, but he is disabled wheelchair-bound and can?t do much. So it all falls to me. Cooking, cleaning, everything.

Second you broke several promises to me. 1) that you would be here for me. 2) you wouldn't move until this lease was almost up and 3) you wouldn't take the babies away  


You hurt me. You friggin killed me the other day. You came to me and said we need to talk. Talking means having a discussion not ""this is how it is and that's that"". You dropped a bomb and expected me to say something like ""ok cool"". How could you think that would be my answer? 

I know you are scared, my health is failing. My kidneys are going, but i was doing everything i could to ensure i would be here for you and your babies. I had 4 tough surgeries to create and move the fistula so i could get dialysis to stay alive for you and them. Because you and they are my entire world. You and they are soo important to me.  I did this to be here, to live for you and them. 

In the week after the surgery, you claim you kept the babies mostly away from me so i could rest. I don't believe that now. I can't. Not with how you left the other day. I believe you kept them away from me because somehow you thought it would make what you did easier. Instead i feel betrayed and stunned by the cruelty behind it.  


""Me and \*\*\*\*\*\*\* are moving to T\*\*\*\* and we are leaving tonight"" is what you told me. No warning, nothing before this, you said you kept it from me because you knew i would be angry but again i wasn't angry. I was hurt, devastated, broken. Then you wouldn't even let me hold, cuddle or even say goodbye to my grandchildren. You left the house to go to your friends and stayed there all day refusing to even let me say goodbye to you.  


and you wondered why i lashed out in my pain?   


For 22 years you have been my rock, my friend, everything to me. I have scrimped, done without and done everything to make sure you had what you needed/wanted. And you  couldn't even give me the chance to have time before you left?

I know why.. him.. because he convinced you that he can't make a life here ""it's too expensive, even you admit it"". i admit it is when i am taking care of 5 people besides myself. When i am the only one paying the bills, only one paying rent, only one providing for everyone. Yes it is expensive, but it would be regardless of where we lived.

So you think where you went will give you that life.. let's see a grown (31 year old man) with at least 2 kids he's paying childsupport on and working a shit job (when he works) is going to make enough for you to have your own place, bills and take care of two more kids one who has special needs? Think about that.   


oh it was easy before he moved here.. after all he lived with others in a roommate situation so not that much rent he had to pay could split the bills, not a big deal to pay child support. That's not the same now.. and you aren't seeing that. and that is if he works.

since he lost his job here what almost a year ago he lived almost free here. he paid a little rent maybe.. well until he didn't. used what money he had to go out to eat, shit like that. He didn't buy more than 3 packs of diapers and wipes. He didn't buy clothes, didn't buy toys, or formula, or anything for those babies.

I bought most of their toys, and clothing, medicine when they needed it. I was your babysitter when you needed one. I helped you, supported you when he was being an ass and he decided to leave before they were born and I let him come back for you. I was there for you when you suspected he cheated on you, hell i even made excuses when he hit on me while courting you, remember. I was honest and showed you the messages and explained them away. (stupid me)

But i am the bad guy,  somehow.

i spent a lot of money on you and him and the babies because i loved you and because i wanted to give you all the life you wanted. I told you go to school and i wont make you pay rent, won't make you get a job so you can get an education to get a better one..

I took you out to eat, bought you stuff, did everything for you, not once to make you feel you owed me, not to make you feel beholden to me but because simply i love you and them.

In the end now i feel that i never mattered to you beyond what i could give you, or spent on you. 

but his mom makes more than i do and gives her money much more freely, after al that's all i have heard since you went down there the first time to visit.

No you aren't money grubbing, that's not what i am saying. I am saying i believe that you think she will give you that life you want so much easier than i can. Support you for longer, after all i am dying.

but isn't she? didn't she have cancer? doesn't she have cancer?

from one dying woman you run to another but she gets all the perks of knowing you were moving, and i get all the heartache, and tears not knowing til you left.

i have been crying since you left, i am broken. I look around here and see you left behind all their toys that i bought them including their favorite toys. You left me a mess to clean up, left some of their stuff here but took what you wanted. Mostly left almost everything i ever bought them wiping me out of their life.

I know he convinced you to leave like you did, and that is why i am mad at him. I am mad only at him. You i cannot believe went along with not letting me hold and say goodbye to my grandkids. i cannot believe that you would be that heartless, that cruel to not even come say goodbye to me. To not even give me time to get used to the idea before you actually did it..

But he wanted to go fast, after all i am now pretty sure the woman he ""bought "" the car from didn't pay for all the repairs, tags and registration out of the goodness of her heart. 

i told you i have no reason to go ahead with dialysis. and i don't. you took that away. you will not make enough to come visit me, or get time off to do so. So i will never seee you or them again..and that hurts sooo much. Because the other day i lost my entire world. I don't know what i am going to do now.. but if i had to decide today.. i wouldn't go on dialysis so maybe its best if there is still time before i make that descision

and if by chance for some reason you do decide to come back, will i even be here? or have room for you. why should i continue to live in a 2 bedroom home when its only me or your uncle til he moves? or if i do get more ill and end up hospitalized or worse? 

A mom's job is to make sure that you have everything you need to continue on when they are gone, to be there to support you and help you when you need. you know that is my philosophy. I can only hope you have those tools and can continue on. 

And you can lie to yourself and say i was being mean, i was being nasty, i wasn't helping enough, doing enough. But i have gone over it and over it and i did more than most ever would have. I did nothing wrong, I did everything for you and maybe that's where i did go wrong.

Last night I went to my roommate?s friend?s 21st birthday party.  I don?t drink often at all but as you can imagine with a college 21st birthday the drinks were plentiful, and everyone there was pretty drunk by 10pm including myself. My roommate?s best friend (lets call him Jim) was also at the party with his girlfriend (lets call her Katie).  For more background, I?m also good friends with both Jim and Katie but my roommate has known them a bit longer.  

Katie has always been the flirty type, especially when she?s drunk and it honestly makes me slightly uncomfortable especially when Jim is around, as I don?t want an awkward dynamic between us all.  Anyway last night she really crossed the line.  I was in the apartment kitchen getting water from the tap and she came up behind me all flirty and handsy.  She started talking about how I?m her favorite of Jim?s friends and how much she liked my new haircut, I was just trying to downplay the compliments.  Then she forcefully threw herself at my face and kissed me pretty hard for a good 2 seconds before I could even register what was going on.  

I?m not going to lie, it felt fucking amazing (I know I?m a loser or whatever first kiss) and it made me feel so happy and appreciated.  Nobody saw this happen (that i know of) and I feel guilty as fuck even know I technically did nothing wrong.  Don?t know if I ever plan on telling Jim but I would be open to any advice, I just really needed to tell someone about it, and the mixed feelings i?m experiencing.

I can remember a very sad memory of me on my Nintendo DS joining empty  pictochat rooms to send message to myself just to feel like someone wanted to talk to me. This along with my parent's constant name calling using words like ?Dumbass? and ?Idoit? have lead me to develop social anxiety.   


?The town I grew up in was nicknamed ?The City of Churches? because there are more churches here than anywhere else in the state. It was also, unfortunately, the last capital of the Confederates States during the Civil War, which gives a lot of people down here pride for the CSA. Naturally, my family was brought up in this environment. The vast majority of people here fit with this specific category of Evangelical, Young-Earth, Creationist, Right-wing, Trump loving, watch Fox News 24/7 a day, morons. The specific church I grew up in had this belief that anxiety, depression, and any worries in life was because the person didn?t trust God enough.   


?Every single day now for nearly 1,298days since October 6, 2015, I?ve been living a lie to my community. October 6, 2015 was the day I left my faith. Because I didn?t grow up with any friends there was no one to turn too in my crisis and even now. Since then I have to lie about my political belief, religious belief, and who I?ve voted for in the last election. Since losing my faith I?ve been lost in life and where I am headed. I?ve got a 2-year degree in something I don?t even like?and work at a restaurant.

&#x200B;

?Because of my many events with social anxiety I?ve felt like most people don?t really care for me at all. Most days I feel completely unloved and uninterested by anyone. At the restaurant I work at there are 2 waitresses I try talking too because they seemed like they were interested in me. One is named Maria once I meet her she seemed like she was interested in me because she was a bit flirtatious but I just assumed she was just being a nice person and didn't think too much in to it, until one of my cousins notice her interest in me and then I started to develop feelings for her. I wish I had listened to myself the first time, Maria has a boyfriend and is likely engaged. After finding this out I just tried to move on to the other waitress that seemed interested in me.  


?The other girl was named Veronica. She wasn't nearly as flirtatious as Maria but she would try to talk to me as well. I don't enjoy my job at all but seeing them there at work just makes me a little bit happier. Because both Maria and Veronica gave effort into talking with me I assumed they liked me, although I didn?t get a lot of girls attention while having social anxiety usually when they had tried talking to me it was because they were interested in me. But I guess it wasn't the case for them.   


?Last Tuesday when I worked I had an emotional breakdown because some asshole party called me a ?dumbass? while I was walking away. This brought back memories and reminded me of my social anxiety. I also started thinking about how I fooled myself into think that Maria or Veronica were not interested in me and I just felt like an unwanted, forgotten, unloved, piss of shit. I broke down and nearly walked out.",0,1556302483.0,bhpjq1,6,offmychest

I?ve never actually gotten it checked out, but I?ll go through these phases where I can?t seem to figure out what the whole point of this is and everything seems pointless. I felt like I had no purpose and I was just living my life day by day. I started gaining weight pretty quickly and everything was just a mess. 

Over winter break, I found my old high school yearbook and saw that my old friend had signed and told me to ?please never stop being my happy self.? It brought me back to high school and I remembered how happy I used to be and how excited I was every morning to simply wake up. So much had changed over those past few years. I started crying and decided I wanted to change things around.

I started dating a friend recently that shares the same hobbies and interests me and it is the most refreshing feeling to have somebody always there. He makes me look forward to the future. While I still have my bad days, it is not nearly as bad as it used to be and it always helps to know that I have somebody there.

Only recently has my father decided to get me help, after being sent to a hospital again because the school counselors think I might be a harm to myself in the near future. 

Yesterday was my first meeting with my out patient therapist. It was all administrative and paperwork stuff, and I was mostly out of it and fidgeting while my father and her filled out paperwork, until she had to do another screening. What always boggles me about screenings is they let the parents stay in the room for it, and expect me to be honest - and they always say I can ask for them to leave, but it's not like my parents are going to not ask me about it, why I couldn't talk in front of them, which is kind of why I'm getting therapy. Most of the questions aren't bad, like if I was pregnant or if I was a felon.

But I suffer from hallucinations and delusions. I was in an abusive relationship. I used to be anorexic-bulimic, and the only reason I'm not anymore is because I physically can't make myself throw up anymore, and last year I blacked out in front of all my friends and I don't want them to find out I'm this unstable. I'm four months clean from self harm but only because my parents regularly check to make sure no knives are missing and that my arms are clean. But I lied about all this, and now I'm stuck living another lie with someone I'm supposed to trust when I can't trust anyone else, and I'm paranoid what will happen when she finds out I lied.

Everything from her having an STD, being pregnant, to the rumor that she had a gang bang at a party. I have to go to the doctors appointments with her, awaiting awkwardly in the waiting room.

Some of the hardest moments were finding out some of the rumors were true because of a school official. I know that this is partly my fault. I was such coward and still am. My ex has had custody of her since the divorce but I never stood up for myself or my beliefs. I didn't like it when my ex allowed her to wear mini-skirts, sheer pants, thongs, or heels. I didn't  feel comfortable that my ex allowed her to go on dates with boys.

I fell in love for the first time during late high school (currently about to start my masters in college). I met her back in middle school when she was a grade ahead of me but she moved away soon after. When she moved back we hit things off and became very close. Talked all day and all night. Stayed close to each other and were always there for each other. She had a lot of emotional problems from her childhood which made it hard to trust people fully but I managed to break through that. 

Eventually she asked if I had feelings for her and I said I did. But she was never looking for a relationship. Rather she focused that part of her mostly on short term flings with no strings attached. Which I thought I was fine with for the longest while. We talked about it a lot and a few times she told me she would give it a try but I said that it had to come from her not from me. Since we were so close I had a pretty clear idea of her romantic life. Sometimes she would talk to me about it and it just made me sad to hear her sad. She said a part of her did reciprocate but that just wasn?t what she was looking for. Being older now I understand that but at the time it was frustrating. She would tell me that  someday if neither of us found someone she would marry me. That idea just kinda stuck with me so I stayed along for the ride. In hindsight that wasn?t the best thing for either of us. Neither of us knew how to properly deal with those emotions. We eventually had a fight. Not about our feelings but fueled by them. I told her I needed time to cool down but I never talked to her after that. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. I mainly have nightmares rather than dreams. I?ve always had a lot on my mind. But one day I didn?t have a nightmare. It was just her.

We agreed that there was no harm in reaching out so I did. I apologized for being so cold to her in the end and for my part in things. And she actually responded. Since then we have been talking more and more. The more I hear the more I remember how much I care about her.

286,286,"Lately, I've been struggling with figuring out what it is I want... 

Or maybe it's more so that I fear having to let go of the person I dreamed of those wants with.

For the past month or so, my ex and I have been 'dating' so we could figure out if we still could be together, still enjoy each other, and if we can heal from the past few years of a very toxic relationship. During this time of ""dating,"" I can't say that he has been entirely honest with me and I constantly feel or see him changing what the terms of ""dating"" mean. 

For example, at first we would be dating and not talking to others... this changed without my being told until I found him talking to others on the plenty of fish app. He convinced me to allow him to talk to others and that that was all it would be, talking so that he could make friends.

Last night, he began saying that he would be also dating others. That I should know that talking to others would include dating. He also discussed that our terms of  ""dating"" are drastically different, which they very much clearly are. In terms of us, I would see dating as more of a serious thing as we are doing this in order to decide if we want a future together... but then isn't that why you also date other people as well? In his eyes, he says he sees dating as just having fun with other people and maybe getting to know other people.

After this discussion, I began to realize a few things... our wants are very different. Personally, I am 31 and at this point, I want marriage and children, that is what I am looking for and clearly not what he is. While, this is what I know I want for myself and what I want as part of my future, I don't know or believe he has the ability to give this to me. I love him and have always seen him as the one I would marry as well as have those children with, but maybe that no longer holds true.

The main point I need to take away and accept is that I  do know what I want. I want to be happy in my life, I want a partner to share it with, and I want to build a family of my own. But a part of me wants that to be with him. Although, there is only a very slim possibility of that happening in the future and it's very unlikely he will give it to me as he is only looking for 'fun' for himself at the present time.

So I need to decide... Do I keep waiting for someone that I love who *may* choose to be a part of my future or do I let go and find the person who shares the same wants as myself?

My parents are out of town and my girlfriend and I were using my mom?s laptop and we saw that she had bookmarked Chatroulette and a porn video. I haven?t  porn in close to a year for her and in my 21 years of life I have never once even considered cheating on a partner, it?s happened to me before and I could never put someone through that kind of pain, but my girlfriend thinks I bookmarked those two pages as well as a Chaturbate page which she opened as a pop-up from opening Chatroulette but she refuses to believe me. I told her the last time I used Chatroulette was around 2013-2015 and I probably bookmarked it then.

I recently had a dream that shook me, for some reason I was an Egyptian wedding planner and I was rushing around getting everything ready. My dad was dressed in some pharaoh-like robes and a few women were flocking around him pulling at his headpiece or re-arranging stuff.

They moved away and stood by a sarcophagus which was lying on a table and lined with linen. They gestured for him to lie in it and tried to lightly pull him to it. My dad pulled out of their grip and shouted ""I'm not dying!"" and sped-walked over to a floor length mirror at the end of the sarcophagus.

today i walked into my form room in the morning, and went up to talk to my friend (A). we used to be in the same friend group and at one point she was one of my closest friends but over the last few months she started to distance herself away and didn?t come sit with us anymore. i knew she had this problem were she had to miss a ton of schooldays because of constant migraines, so i assumed she just needed to be alone. i would often go and sit with her at lunch, but the rest of my friends would just ignore her. now i regret not sitting and talking with her more often.

when i came up to her i joked about with her and we talked a little, until i noticed her skirt riding up a bit. when i saw the scars, i thought she had just fallen over into a bush or something. but as i looked closer, i knew that those cuts couldn?t be done so cleanly by a branch. they were small, in twos, scattered across both of her thighs.

i asked her whats up with her legs, to which she said jokingly ?don?t question it.? but throughout my lessons until break, i couldn?t stop thinking about those cuts.

at break i felt sick, i felt like vomiting and had to go the toilets and take a break. after, i just felt so selfish for getting upset when what A was feeling was probably 100x worse. i felt like a failed as a friend, that i should have noticed the signs before she went to self harm. deleting some of her social media?s for her mental health, distancing herself more and more, leaving lessons suddenly. it made sense.

304,304,"\[M18\] In my junior year of HS, I was joking around with my friend (we'll call him Bill) saying how he flirts with every cute girl he sees on Facebook. As a joke, I thought it would be funny to set up a catfish account and joke with him a little since I knew he would message first, until I finally revealed it was me a week later. To cover up my identity, I sent friend requests to about 200 people in my school, and I played as an underclassmen. I asked if anyone wanted to DM me, and of course he messaged the catfish account first saying that I was ""cute."" The joke was successful and Bill and my friends thought it was funny once I revealed myself to them.

However, I kind of underestimated how thirsty guys were, and I maybe got over 100 messages from dudes all over my school trying to plow my sophomore alter ego. I only responded to a few people I knew to get a little chuckle from their responses, but I got bored of it after about a day and I just sort of forgot about it. There was one kid in particular though, who was pretty insistent to showing how um... sexually attracted he was to me. He would comment nut emojis under my profile picture, and DM me some pretty creepy shit (I know he wasn't joking because people have bashed him for saying shit like ""Bonerrific"" or how much he wanted to smash his ex-girlfriend under their photos). We'll call this kid Wolverine, since he had a strange obsession with him, and even had the sideburns grown out in inspiration of his haircut.

Now what I didn't know, was that I accidentally left my phone number on my Facebook account, and he was able to track down my Snapchat. What's even worse, is that my Snapchat profile picture was of one of my friends who knew about the catfish account, and Wolverine tried exposing him on Facebook. My friend and I tried to make light of the situation, but Wolverine kept writing long paragraphs out of blue ball anger. He said some pretty personal things for no reason, and my friend got a little angry and started beefing with him as a result. Out of nowhere, Bill comes in and starts goofing on Wolverine (they've talked a bit of shit to each other the year before, so I already knew this was going to end badly).

They ended up talking so much shit that Bill and Wolverine agreed to fight after school the next day, and talked about how they were going to beat each other's asses. In the thread of maybe 1000 comments, I jumped in multiple times telling them that fighting over something like just to get suspended was incredibly stupid. I even messaged Bill personally to forget about the whole thing, but he told me not to worry and that it's his choice if anyone gets in trouble.

I don't know what happened in detail the next day, since I wasn't there to see the fight, but apparently they saw each other in the hallway and flailed at each other for 2 seconds before they were split up by a teacher. They were put in ISS for 2 days and there were a bunch of rumors spread out saying that I intentionally set them up to fight after setting up a false date with both of them through the catfish account. Wolverine started ranting the next day about how he was wrongfully punished for fighting back in self-defense, which was obvious bullshit that most people called him out for. Me, my friends and Bill sort of just laughed it off and forgot about it.

I got some backlash for making the catfish account in the first place, which is understandable in a sense. I'm not going to deny the fact that I was a loser in high school, but I really never did encourage Bill and Wolverine to fight over something so stupid. It was just unnecessary and reckless.

This whole story is probably one of the reasons why I'm off social media like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. A lot of it is just stupid drama and I don't want any part in that kind of thing. On the outside, I would shrug off the situation if someone from my old high school were to bring it up. Yet, there are some days where I look back on this story and I feel like a huge asshole in this situation for accidentally having Bill and Wolverine re-encounter, only for them to fight for 2 seconds.

tl;dr - i set up a catfish account to mess with my friend, but it ended up gaining a lot of attraction from other guys and a kid got so offended that he tried to expose me and started writing long paragraphs to me and my friends after being blue balled. the friend that i messed with got mad at the pervy kid and they ended up fighting and being put in ISS for 2 days.",0,1556331504.0,bhuhi2,1,offmychest

For a long time I dealt with mixed feelings about you. There was hatred, questioning, longing for you, disgust, everything possible that I could feel; I felt.

You left when I was four. You left me with a dad who was so sick at the time he had to crawl on his hands and knees to get around. He had slipped a disc and been diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease. My family has told me you didn?t even shed a tear when you got me dressed and put me on the school bus. I remember coming home and asking my dad where you were. I don?t remember exactly what he said but I do remember he kept reiterating that he would explain it to me once I was old enough to understand. The next year  would bring a lot of pain. My dad would proceed to become even sicker, developing many more health problems. I didn?t hear from you again until my baby brother was born  and my dad brought me to the hospital to see you and meet him. I didn?t hear from you for a while after that. 

I remember getting to visit you once, I came over for the weekend. You put on some facade of a ?loving mother? but only for a short time. We made a fruit salad, I was so happy. I was so happy to see you. I remember thinking how beautiful you were and how much I missed you. That night came crashing to an end when your new husband got fucked up on pills and started throwing knifes and forks at my baby brother and I, and through the innocent eyes of a child, I watched him choke you in the bathroom. You made me sleep on a blue cot in the living room of a strange house with no blanket or pillow. I came into your room after having a nightmare; only to have you and your husband cuss and scream at me. I sat on the cot and cried until I eventually went to sleep. You told me ?you cannot tell your dad what happened when you go home, or else you won?t get to see me anymore.? I was terrified. My dad noticed when I got home that I was acting strange, and kept asking me what was wrong.  I finally broke down and told him, and remember feeling so disappointed in myself that I had let you down. He said he was so mad that he saw red for two days. I stopped getting to see you. I thought it was my fault. 

At some point, I forgot what you looked like. I would have dreams about ?you? but it would always be a woman with pink hair for some reason. Every birthday and holiday I would wish that you were there. I would question my dad if I was the reason you left, I would convince myself that it had to be me. I assumed that anyone else who came into my life would abandon me. You gave me my first set of trust issues. I was in the 4th grade, my dad aspirated in his sleep and gets put into a medically induced coma. You decide it?s a great time to start a custody battle. I fail the 4th grade, due to stress and not being able to focus on my school work. This turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. I ended up becoming friends with an amazing, supporting group of people. Over the years, you would be in and out of my life. Having multiple husbands and boyfriends over the years. You would develop a drug addiction and become an alcoholic. You would steal your mother, my grandmothers pain medicine while she was dying from cancer. When I was finally old enough to understand, my dad revealed to me that you had cheated on him with the husband that choked you. I saw how bad you hurt my dad. He went to his grave still loving you for some reason; I found the love letters and poems he had written for years after you left. 

Thank you for giving me the most amazing dad that I could have ever had. Someone who loved me unconditionally and supported me though everything I did in life. Someone who for 18 years played the role of mom and dad. Someone who did the best they could despite their health issues. Someone who instilled in me love, respect, and empathy for others. Someone who never ceased to make me feel loved when I felt like my own mother couldn?t love me. Thank you for giving me the motivation to have a good life, a life nothing like yours. Thank you for leaving me; I couldn?t imagine how bad my life would have turned out with you as an influence. Because of you, I strive to do well in school and make something of myself. I?ve worked so hard to get myself into nursing school. Thank you for never being a mom so that when I become a mother, I can give my child all the love that you never gave me. 

Thank you, ?mom?. I no longer harbor any ill feelings for you. I know it sounds harsh but if you were to die right now I don?t believe I could grieve. I?ve always grieved over you so much in life.

307,307,"As the title says, last Wednesday one of my best friends was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa Binge/Purge type. I only found this out because I facetimed her last night to catch up (as we are both in college). There are a lot of details - she is a D1 track athlete, and has always had pressure to be at her so called ""optimal race weight"". I was so shocked because she is the most healthy person I have ever met, and I literally try to model my lifestyle off of her. But honestly, it all checks out. She is the most gorgeous person I have ever known and admittedly I have had a thing for her in the past.  I started asking her questions which I thought were both non incriminating and also thought-provoking to her - maybe stuff that she has not considered. 

&#x200B;

For example - 

""So what's your plan...what are you gonna do?"" The therapist she saw recommended she start an intensive 4x per week therapy program, but in her mind she can't do that because she 1) doesn't have the money (True) and 2) It will interfere with her running track and her scholarships (Maybe true).  She does not plan on telling her family because she ""knows they will get too involved"". She also does not have the most open relationship with her parents. She DOES know that there is something wrong with her, but she describes it like being gollum from lord of the rings. She gets literal euphoria from purging now. 

&#x200B;

""Who is your support system right now. Who have you told?"" She has only told me, her athletic trainer, and two of her roommates who are her best friends - she does not plan on telling her family. Apparently she broke down to her roommate the other morning and told her everything (apparently this has been going on for 3 years). Her roommate brought her in for an emergency visit to the school's mental health center. 

&#x200B;

I basically told her that it saddened me, and reemphasized how serious it was and that I hope she can get help.  

&#x200B;

So here's where I'm at -

I am not ignorant to the disease by any means. I know that it is a mental condition and not out of vanity, and she knows that she can count on me for my support. I know MY plan, which is to not change how I interact with her. I also told her that she SHOULD tell her parents about it because they will be able to help financially and even if their actions may seem overbearing, they will be coming from a place of love and concern - not from a place of anger or disgust. I want to help her get healthier and feel confident about her body, but I know that my responsibilities should be limited and I shouldn't make this the new forefront of our relationship. I know that her getting better will take time (even years).  I GUARANTEE, for every one thing she says she hates about her body, I could name five things I admire about her. Lol. Yet I know that is not going to get anyone anywhere.

&#x200B;

How might I encourage her to continue getting help even if she is seemingly reluctant?

&#x200B;

What could I have improved with how I handled her telling me about her situation, if at all?

&#x200B;

How do I (should I) convince her to tell her parents, who will most likely be her largest supporters during this time? I realize with a mental illness like this, she has to be the one making all of the decisions, so it makes sense to me that I should not be the one to let her parents know. (That would be out of place - but correct me if I'm wrong).

&#x200B;

As one of her best friends, where is the line or boundary with what I am able to vocalize to her? 

&#x200B;

I care so much about her and really want the best for her.",0,1556309596.0,bhqvto,3,offmychest
308,308,"Throwaway because she knows my main account.

We met at a social group and ended up really clicking. We've known each other for about a year now, and a little while ago I started developing feelings. I tried sorting through it with my therapist because I knew things wouldn't work, and didn't act on it. She ended up having to drag it out of me at one point and we talked about it. She's not attracted to me, which I figured, but also lamented that fact because the friendship otherwise is great. There's fondness, trust, understanding and respect, not to mention a similar sense of humor, and of course she's absolutely gorgeous and intelligent. I'll admit, I identified as a gay man for a while, but my crush on her made me realize that I am actually *wildly* bisexual.

After a bit she also discussed having sex with me since she was a virgin and wanted to ""get that part over with."" (I know, now, and my therapist pointed that out) Of course it didn't work out. It was mostly heavy petting at best, and me doing things to her. It was really frustrating.

After that we tried the cuddle buddy route. I was actually really happy about that, as it felt good and was more than I was really hoping for. Until someone else from that group met up with her one day, they were hanging out as friends at first until the other gal (not my friend) tried to push her into having sex, then pressured her to cuddle. She couldn't do it with me after that. That part hurt, as it felt like *I* was being punished for someone else being an asshole, but I HAVE NOT and WILL NOT bring that up to her, as it's selfish and is my issue to deal with. It still hurts though.

I've been through a lot of abuse in my life, to the point where I look back and can't think of *anyone* that was ever as truly into me as I was them. I was a verbal and emotional punching bag, and sometimes unwilling jerkoff sleeve for some of them. I sometimes feel a bit used by her, though I don't think she's doing it on purpose.

The other issue though, is that at one point she said to me ""If you do manage to convince me to date you you should see that as a win. All's fair in love and war, and all.""

Both my therapist and my big brother asked me ""what is that supposed to mean?"" All I could say was ""I don't know."" But I don't *want* to have to knock myself out for someone like that, as I've done it before, with most of my past relationships, and I don't see having to *convince* someone to fall in love with me like that as a ""win"".

I've fallen into a depressive hole over this once before, and now I feel like I'm about to again. It hurts that I don't even have ONE halfway decent relationship to look back on and say ""at least they actually cared, at least they tried."" I have been thinking for about a month now that I might have to tell her that we need space. It sucks because she's a good friend otherwise, just young, immature about relationships (she wants someone who can sweep her off her feet, and I can't do that because I have spinal issues that necessitate a wheelchair sometimes among other things. She didn't just tell me that, I asked. My fuckup), and struggling with other stuff. All these and other reasons why I tried to keep my crush a secret and work on it on my own.

I keep doing this. Trying to bust my ass for someone I like that doesn't feel the same way. I'm still so codependent and while I've been trying to work on it it's still hard.

I'm not sure I'm ready for dating or a romantic relationship, but trying to find a FWB is hard too, and doesn't really give me what I want and need too. Doesn't help that I'm always broke and working on getting disability. Maybe when I have more income it'll be easier, and I imagine that's not helping my self-esteem either.

327,327,"Monday was my first wedding anniversary. It should be exciting, but I just found myself bitter and angry. My sister-in-law just got engaged, they are getting married in 2020 on the 25th of this month. She was part of my wedding party. I asked her to be my maid of honor because I have no friends and I had hoped her and I would become really good friends, that didn't happen. She severely let me down. I ended up doing most things alone and no one asked me what I wanted to do for my bachelorette party, so we ended up doing something I truly hated. I felt alone the entire time I was planning my wedding. Honestly, if I could go back I wouldn't have wanted a bridal party. We did one because my husband has lots of good friends and he really wanted them to stand up there with me. So I put together a mix-match of my husband's family, his close female friend, my family, and one friend who I don't see really anymore. 

&#x200B;

My wedding wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I know that people say it shouldn't be considered the most important day of your life, but as someone who never gets acknowledgment or the opportunity for just one day to be about them, I wanted it to be. Picked out a beautiful venue and put together a great plan, and of course, it rains. So no outside ceremony, instead we got the ugly pavilion which is now part of all my pictures and my video. My family left right after dinner, they didn't stay for anything extra and honestly, all I had attend was family so the room was extremely empty except for my husband's friends and family. We ended the reception early because people were leaving because we picked a Sunday because of the date. He was born 2/22 and I am born 6/22, so we got married on 4/22. Corny, I know, but I liked that it was directly 2 months between his birthday and my birthday. 

&#x200B;

Looking back at my pictures I hate the dress I picked. I have large shoulders and arms and doing a strapless dress was stupid. I look awful. All that money spent on a gown that I now hate in pictures, plus the fact that you can see remnants of my back tattoo that wasn't completely removed. I wish I could go back and not have a videographer, especially with the ceremony not being held in the garden, it was a waste of money. 

&#x200B;

So throughout my engagement, I did everything pretty much alone or with my husband. So, my sister-in-law (maid of honor) got engaged less than a month ago. I can't stop the envy and hatred I keep feeling for her and her engagement. I found ways to skip the initial dinners after it happened just so I wouldn't have to see the ring, or her joy, or any of that. I was already jealous of how cute she and her fiance are together. They are such a cute couple, both thin and photogenic. Taking lots of pictures together and just being loved by all who come in contact with them. While my husband and I are both big, don't photograph well, and I am a severe let down in comparison with how much people love him. So I now get to see tons of Facebook posts of their engagement pictures and her constant posting about her wedding. I then started to make myself sick at the thought of her asking me to be in her bridal party. The fear of being a pity member of a bridal party that will contain lots of thin, ultra pretty girls with perfect hair, makeup, and actual friendship. I finally broke down to my husband about not wanting to be in it because I would ultra stand-out and I would know, deep down, that I was a pity member. Her asking because I am her brother's wife and not because we are actually friends. I recognize how self-centered this is because she hasn't asked and I shouldn't feel so special that I would get asked. I recognize that, but this is a fear that has been lingering inside of me. 

&#x200B;

I am envious of how perfect everything is going for her. I am envious of the fact that my day was not perfect and most likely, because of how her luck runs, hers will be perfect. I want to be happy for her but at the same time, I want to yell at her how much she let me down as a maid of honor.

&#x200B;

Of course, when I have voiced all of what you just read to my husband he gets sad that I feel our wedding wasn't great or perfect. He loved our wedding. It makes him feel like he isn't good enough, but that isn't what I mean with any of this. If anything, he was the only thing perfect through that entire day. 

&#x200B;

 So I have now taken to not mentioning any of this to my husband, which I hate. He is my best friend and anything I don't say to him just sits inside of me. There is no one else to say it to. So, I am hoping by putting this out here it will help get it off my chest and I can try to be a good and supportive person. Fingers crossed!",0,1556328051.0,bhtza8,1,offmychest

We were engaged for some time how and due to finances at the time, Wedding talk could only be a talk. I work hard full time non stop. I put her through school (cost me $15k+). She graduated and finally we were back on track after long years of stressful, and mentally draining times for both of us.

We finally were able to travel places, take mini trips and everything was fine and dandy. I gave this girl EVERYTHING. If I didnt have the money for it I would some how make it happen.

Fast forward to maybe a month ago. I was having bad anxiety at night, having the worst thoughts about me and her,  day after day past and the thoughts were still there How ever I do want to say, she never gave me reasons to have thoughts. It was just me being a guy and wanted to be assured.

So this most recent Easter passes and we come hope from family functions. In the evening  I could not handle another night of anxiety so simply I wanted to clear the air. I simply asked her ""are we good?"" and I explained what I been going through at night and just wanted to make sure it was just all in my head.

Now i'm here posting about my heartbreak... It was not a 5 minute discussion and done, it was a sleepless night. Finally sun comes up, after she had her coffee I asked her if her thoughts were still the same as last night. She softly said ""yes"" so I asked her ""so is this the end of us? so I can know what to do?"" She stayed quiet, so i said "" Your silence and crying gives me your answer, If you feel like this decision will make you happier that I was, I respect and understand you decision"" and walked out the room devastated.

Yes, I did ask questions during the talk like ""if there was anyone one else"" ETC. I genuinely believe her with she said there wasn't.

Long story short, she said she felt we were growing apart(which ALOT of people do) and she felt like she has changed in the last year and does feel like I can keep up... In my thought I asked myself if I paid($15k+) to build her up to leave me? (Of course our minds will always think worst.)

Like I said Of course our minds are going to think the worst and want blame our selves even though we know we did everything. I guess I have to accept that people do change through time and hurts like hell but I do believe god has a plan(I tried to question faith out of anger by the way)

I have been casually seeing this guy for about a month and a half. We both agreed on keeping things friends with benefits, because we aren't super compatible romantically but we have fun together, rock climb together, and the sex was fun too.

&#x200B;

Within the past 3 weeks I had decided I didn't want to sleep with him anymore. I could feel myself getting kind of emotionally too invested and hurt by some of his actions outside of our sex/hangouts. I also have some confusion/trauma around sex and when I start feeling this way about someone, I shut down in the sex department and I have a hard time with communication. I planned to talk to him and tell him all of this when I next saw him. Yesterday he invited me to go rock climbing, and I said yes.

&#x200B;

I obviously was expecting rock climbing and didn't expect him to come on to me while we climbed because we climb together pretty frequently and he never has. Well, after our climb at the bottom of the crag, as we are packing our things up, he starts touching me and making out. I had yet to have the talk with him, as I was saving it for the ride back. I immediately shut down and said we should head back to the car because it was getting cold.

&#x200B;

Like I said before, I have a very hard time saying ""no"" to men because of past traumas and often instead of just saying no, I dissociate and freeze up. He continued to make out with me and touch me, and I just kind of dissociated from it. I finally turned around to pack up the rest of my things, which is when he kissed my neck, pulled down my pants and panties and we had sex, or rather he just had sex with me. I never said no, I dissociated, I went along with it just so it would be over. The whole time I was just thinking I wanted to be done. He finished within like a minute, apologized for cumming too quickly and then we packed up.

&#x200B;

I felt so used and gross. Like I was just a vessel for him to have sex with or something. He didn't even try to make me feel good, or engage in foreplay. He just  fucked me. But I never said no, I stayed quiet and just let it happen. I feel disgusting, and numb for just letting someone do that to me. To just use my body, and to not speak up for myself.

331,331," 

I will say that there's going to be talk of suicide here, no one actually commits suicide, but there's a lot of talk about it.

I'm  a senior in high school, and the kid I'm talking about, who I'll call R  if needed, is in the 10th grade. We have the same second block class  and we sit beside each other. Throughout the semester the group that we  sit around has gotten ""closer"", as in we just fuck around the whole  class, but that's about it. We're not *actually* closer or like, close knit friends or anything.

R  is basically a Kurt Cobain wannabe, and it's extremely cringy to listen  to him talk about him so much, even going as far as to call him his  mentor, or say that he is the reincarnation of him. I think the last one  was a joke, I hope. Regardless, he's obsessed with Nirvana, which in my  opinion is a phase he will grow out of. I was obsessed with Nirvana, as  well as many others. It gets old. Anyways, he's still a decent kid,  he's funny, and I would go as far as to call him a friend, but I'm  starting to get a little irritated. Him and his best friend have been  having issues, and it's a pretty garbage situation, but if the old best  friend wants to act the way she is, that's on her. People turn their back on you sometimes, but you'll meet new people.

He  also apparently has a pretty shit home life. He says his mother kicked  him out of the house and basically only lets him come in to get food, to  shower, or to get new clothes. Otherwise, he's outside, and apparently  he's had to sleep on the side of a street. I don't know how true this  is, and I find it hard to believe. He's extremely attention seeking as  well, which is an issue that should be handled on it's own, and I don't  think it's something he should be shamed for. I think it's due to  circumstance and possible mental illness. Yesterday and today he came  into class and talked about how much he wanted to die, about how much he  didn't want a funeral, and he wanted his ashes to be put into a trash  bag and so on. Listening to him drone on and on about him dying was  getting on my nerves and quite frankly, I'm getting sick of it.

Here's  the thing. I've been through the same thing. The contemplating suicide,  but not really ever doing anything about it because you know deep down  things aren't always going to be like this. I sound super selfish  admitting all of this, but I have my own problems, and I don't need to  feel like I'm taking responsibility for some kid's life. I'm not. I  still have my own issues, my own set of mental illness problems, I can't  be someone else's therapist. Today, he literally asked me, ""Can I  commit?"" I said no. He didn't finish the entire question, but I knew  what it was about. He asked multiple people and then proceeded to  explain, ""You'll be in my suicide note, and here are XYZ reasons why.""  He also flashed around these scrapes he scratched into his arm and asked  if he could do more or do worse.

And  then came the super-extra awkward part. He asked me that if things  didn't go well with his best friend, would I be his best friend. I don't  do best friends at this point. I get walked all over, I get taken  advantage of, and honestly, he's too young. I have my boyfriend, and  that's all I currently need. I said yes because I have zero backbone,  but if he genuinely expects me to deal with this shoving suicide in my  face constantly, I'm not dealing with it. Fuck, I'll fucking report him  to the counselor or a teacher if I have to. If he wants to be  possibly-serious about it, he needs help, and I'll tell them all about  what he's been saying.

335,335," In high school, I had very few close friends who were my age. My closest confidantes were a year or two older or younger; a year really makes all the difference. I've always had a somewhat childish personality; I can't goof off with anyone like I can with the guys I knew in high school who are currently juniors and seniors. I can only genuinely say I've had one best friend, and that was born out of years and years of building trust, but I moved around so much as a kid that we rarely talk anymore.

After making it to college, I made friends with multiple different friend groups who were in my year, but never *truly* connected with them except one person. I've always been a one-close-friend kind of girl, as opposed to many-distant-friends. Around this time, I was going through a breakup and didn't want to feel the hurt, so I saved it for later. First semester, I got closer to that one friend and convinced myself that I had feelings for him because I didn't want to think about the breakup. It was a blessing in disguise that that same friend rejected me, because I realized later that I was using him as an escape. My ex and I started up again, this time on a long distance relationship.

He had changed, though, since I'd last seen him, and our round two only lasted a month. But this second breakup was the real closure I needed, because neither of us had wanted to break up during round one. The thing was, now that we were officially over, I was forced to wake up and not feel as numb as I'd been feeling during and after the relationship. And apparently, I had a *lot* of baggage that I had to deal with.

I had to deal with my distant relationship from my parents, with the fact that my self esteem was not as high as I'd originally thought it was, with the realization that the friends I have aren't life-long ones. Further, that one friend and I got more distant as I started developing feelings for him again. I'm still not sure if those feelings were real, or if they were just a response to the baggage that dropped all at once.

Anyway, this was all raging whiplash to my college friends. I even felt it myself; I was full of life, and then somewhere along the way I had an existential crisis and now I have to fake smiles. I feel like they're exhausted that there's always something bad happening to me, so I try to pick my chin up and be the way I was before. I know that they're not *actually* annoyed with me, but I can't help feeling that way. Then the dynamic between me and my close friend shifted for the worse, because he still wasn't interested and I didn't want to confront him about my feelings since I was dealing with so much else. A rejection on top of that wouldn't have helped.

Now, I feel lonelier than ever. Everyone I feel comfortable with is at least five-hundred miles away from me. I hardly trust anyone here enough to confide in, and the one person here who I *would* confide in is pushing me away because he doesn't want to give me false romantic hope. Everyone has a friend who's close to them; I'm not even pissed that that friend isn't me. I see everyone with people who they've known for forever, who they trust more than anyone in the world, who'll stick with them no matter what problems they're going through. I want that so badly. I have so many people who I can ring up to go to a party with, but I no longer have That One Person who I can call in the middle of the night for some hole-in-the-wall Mexican food or a late-night drive to a whole other state. All the friends I have right now, I feel like they won't want me when I'm sad or down, and a lot's been going on recently that I've been sad and down a lot. They've said and shown that they're happy to stand by my side while I get back up, but deep down I can tell that they'd rather spend time without me around to kill the party.

Her and I left shortly after that and to be honest I probably wouldn?t have given the incidence another thought. But when we were in the taxi talking she brings it up again and starts telling me how this guy was all over her the entire night.

Just the week before we went to a concert with another friend and she said our friend's boyfriend tried to kiss her when they went to get us drinks. She begged me not to tell our friend.

Anyway, after the first time she broke up I was angry at first (I'd broken up with her) and I took a trip to London alone that was meant to be for us. I saw friends while I was down there and hooked up with one girl and thought right, that's it, I'm over her. I was wrong. I never cut contact with her but she blocked me on a few things, but I still checked in and stuff mainly to make sure she was ok. She was, she seemed like she was flourishing, and she seemed like the person I'd always said that she could be and how I wished she was ( bit shitty of me but idk).

I didn't even want to meet him but eventually I just thought ""Fuck it, let's do this"" and gave it a go. When we first talked, something about him intrigued me, and that sensation was confirmed when we met in person. We immediately clicked, spent hours talking and I felt head over heels about him and it was mutual.

One month into this situationship, we've been in constant contact, always hanging out anytime we can, we've been treating each other kindly and affectionately, we even already have inside jokes and the chemistry between us is from another world, something I've never experienced, and I started questioning my feelings towards him for a while, trying to convince me that it's impossible to fall for someone in such a brief time. Joke's on me, I've never been truly in love with any of my previous partners (or at least I was in love of the idea of them), but this time I can see the person he is, and he's wonderful, caring, brilliant, handsome, I could go on for hours.

I was totally satisfied about being on the same wavelenght, or so I thought.

I've always wanted to be in an open relationship, since I felt suffocated by monogamy in my previous exclusive relationships, and when we decided the ""terms"" of our affinity I couldn't feel more excited about it.

To my surprise she didn't really care or try to stop us from going. So we went. Fast forward to the next morning at 7 AM, she is blowing up me and my sister's phone non stop. Telling us how it's not safe and to go home immediately. Being half asleep, we didn't really pay any mind to her and just fell asleep again. 9 AM comes she is calling again, so I answer. Same convo, ""it's not safe, it's dirty"" So I tell her, being half asleep, ""if it's not safe, I wouldn't be talking to you. So relax, we are leaving now."" Throughout the day, she was out. But when dinner rolls around, she goes off. She is yelling at me at full speed, about how it's not safe, how it's dirty. That there are diseases in the chairs and beds, how those places are for prostitutes (she is an immigrant from a different country, so she bought a lot of those beliefs here to the US). I try to tell her it's not the same and how it's not like that here (honestly, I'm not really sure but this place was a proper spa, I had done my research). But she doesn't care and doesn't even hear me. She continues about how I could even think about bring my younger sister there, she is over 18 and more rebellious than me, nothing I could've done would have stopped her anyways. 

This all happened at the beginning of dinner so I left the table, I decided that I didn't need the negativity coming from her and I have no more interest in eating with her in that situation. I feel like I should have let her go off, but it was more stressful keeping my mouth shut than leaving. I definitely could have yelled and argued with her, but learning from experience, it was better to just not saying anything to her. I understand where she's coming from that she was worried about my safety, but at the same time, if she was worried, why didn't she say something to me BEFORE I went? I could've stayed home or find a different activity to do. It feels like she planned this out to have an argument with me. It's bothering me more than I thought it would.",0,1556325561.0,bhtlxr,1,offmychest
340,340,"I've been friends with the guy since around 2-3 years ago and he's become one of my closet friends. We both like a lot of the same things and have deep and meaningful conversations about every kind of topic. Obviously we have things we disagree on and its always nice to debate about them. 

Anyways, he told me he was gay about a few months after we started hanging out and I didn't really thought anything about it. Its not something that would made me feel more distant towards him cause I really enjoyed my time him. He knew I was straight and so he didn't try to make moves on me. However, when we where at parties and drunk, his control over his pulsions would sometimes making him do things he wouldn't normally do, as all people who are intoxicated.

One time, maybe around 1 year ago, we where coming back from a party and since my house was close, he crashed at my place to sleep. We had another few drinks and were quite drunk. Before we went to sleep, he was being very touchy touchy and I didn't really think anything about it cause I was hammered but he started slowly bringing me towards the room in which he was sleeping. He then kind of pushed me on the bed and I told him something along the lines of ""dude what are you doing?"". He told me""you know what I'm doing"" and at that point I just wanted to go to sleep so I just told him to give me a kiss on the cheek so I could get out of the situation. He did so and I went back to my room to sleep. We both woke up the next morning like nothing happened, but I felt really awkward about it and I never told him about it.

Another time, he was at my home and I was taking a shower. Again, we where both drunk and comming back from a party. Just for context, he crashed a lot of times at my place and the examples I'm giving are just very few instances. Anyways, he then entered the bathroom and I was like ok whatever but he the procedeed to enter the shower. Again, I told him something along the lines of ""dude what the hell"" and quickly finished rinsing the soap to get out. Same thing next morning, everything went back to normal and I didn't told him how uncomfortable he made me feel.

The last time he did something sketchy was when we were at a friends party a few weeks ago and went to the bathroom together to take a piss. I do this very often with him and other guys when were drunk cause we don't really care and want to continue the conversation were having. As we were talking and pissing, he just suddenly grabed my dick with is index and tumb and told me I had a big dick. On the moment, again, I didn't really think anything about it and even said thanks as a reflex. The next morning, my feelings all came crashing down and I thought ok this is enough, I have to talk to him about it.

I always postponed this thought since I'm not someone who shares my feelings to others a lot and I abhor the thought that speaking out might create a conflict. The guy is one of my bestfriends and I didn't know what would happen if I spoke out to him about how his actions made me feel really uncomfortable. 

Anyways, I sorted out my thoughts and feelings and the next weekend, when we were outside alone at a party, I talked to him about of I felt. I told him about my feelings and how he needed to stop doing those kind of things and he interrupted me in middle of my sentence and said ""I understand, I won't ever do something like that again"". He told me how he felt from his perspective that, even though he knows I'm straight, he always had that hope inside of him that I could reciprocrate his feelings. He had more hookups with straight guys than gay ones so he always thaught it could be a possibility. He said he was really glad I told him about it instead of keeping it for me.

I just feel so relieved right now and like I'm on a cloud. I never thought expressing my feelings could make me feel so good. I want to finish this post by telling to everyone that felt like I did about sharing your feelings, don't think that way. You will feel so much better after expressing yourself and telling others, especially your closed ones, how you feel.

I've been completely in love with this girl for over a month now and I've said nothing. She is one of the kindest, most beautiful people I've ever met. She is caring and nice and she is a really genuine person. I can't look away from her, both physically and mentally, I actually kinda want to ask her on a date. Here is the catch though. I am getting married to the mother of my child this August and this crush is fucking destroying me. 

It feels so fucking wrong to have these feelings for her as I know that I love my fianc? and I love my child. At the same time I know that I am young, very young. My son was born the spring before I turned sixteen. And now me and my fianc? are getting married a week after I'm 18 and can legally marry. 

And I'm kinda having second thoughts and kinda not. We've been together for 5 years, so it kinda feels like we belong together. At the same time I feel like this would have ended a long time ago if not for our kid. And I don't want him to grow up in a split home. My parents are still friends but it was such a hassle having to move every week and shit like that.

I feel so fucking bad and it feels like my heart is about to give out and I just want to forget the crush forever but at the same time I cherish her friendship so fucking much and I don't want to lose it.

346,346,"A bit more then a year ago I left rehab. Rehab was necessary because I had to recover from stemmcell transplantation after being diagnosed with leukemia. I was 26 at the time and obviously the whole thing was a big hit on my family and especially on my mother. I always was a pretty rational cool headed guy and therefore had already thought about the concept of dying and obviously preferred to stay alive but I realized my mother was suffering more then I did. 

It was probably the toughest thing I ever did calling her and telling her the bad news (I don't live close to where my family lives that's why I called). Going on from there I struggled a lot because I needed to endure chemotherapy but also make sure that my mom stayed afloat mentally. I think any mom would handle such a situation with difficulty and I tried to support her as much as I could by assuring that things were going well and I was doing OK (which I actually was, therapy went well, I had lots of friends visiting and when my family visited we could even head out for ice cream or stuff like that).

After about 6 months of intense therapy I received my stemmcell transplant from my sister (little annoying siblings can actually be really useful I learned).  The results afterwards couldn't have been better and since then I made my comeback. Now 1 year afterwards I am 100% back to my life, back at my apartment, back to university, back to my part time job - it feels as if all of the sh\*t didn't happen.

Ok. So let's start by saying this was a gradual descent into hating this company, the last straw situation. I am a registered veterinary technician (animal nurse) and have always advocated for insurance as a benefit to pets and owners financially. This company also ""prides"" them selves in having the most coverage compared to any other companies, and for some cases Ive seen, I've been pleasantly surprised at what they had covered. Started out with positive view of them here, but boy, have they ever pissed me off now.

I'll start with a history here, a bit about my role in this, then I'll explain the insurance part. 

Smushers is our now 8 month old kitten who's got a slew of issues that have slowly each presented themselves as he grown older. I am a registered veterinary technician (animal nurse) and work in an emerge/reg practice currently. When I first got him, he was 6 weeks old. He was part of a litter of kittens who was being fostered by another technician, and he was the fattest floof of all of them. He was majestically plump. I, being a technician, had always advocated for medical Inssurance for pets, because medical issues can be costly and I had know that young animals are very prone to foreign bodies (ie, eating string, toys, things they shouldnt) and requiring surgery. So, being the proactive technician I thought I was, at 6 weeks old I signed him up for insurance. 

Now let's start the medical history lineage. 

At 8 weeks old I brought our beautiful white floof to my colleague veterinarian as a kitten 1st vaccine appointment (my first mistake there) Everything was great, until he listened to his heart. He had a whopping murmur and his heart sounded like an ocean. This was only 2 weeks after his enrollment, so the doctor didn't note it in the files but had verbally told me. This insurance company has a 30day wellness period in which anything noted isn't covered medically. I had called the company to ask a few questions about heart coverage and claims, and had gotten some disheartening news, but carried on. 

Fast forward to October 12th, 1 day after his wellness waiting period for coverage is over. Hes not doing well, fast breathing, dull, excessive drooling, diarrhea, vomiting, head pressing against objects, and hes still a small kitten even for now being 3 months old. Is this his heart or something new now?
Took blood, he was anemic, had low BUN and Creatinine values which were leading us to think liver shunt. Wanted to check out his heart at this point to see what was going on. Had ultrasound and result was sent off to cardiologist which came back as right side heart enlargement with mitral valve deformations, not impeding or causing any clinical signs seen currently. 
Ok, so his heart sucks but isnt the cause of his current symptoms. What now? More diagnosis to find out what the heck IS going on. 

Gave antibiotics which resolved his issues and further strengthened the notion that maybe he had a liver shunt and his symptoms wernt related to his heart. Few weeks later tried lactulose, he improved again, strengthening possible liver shunt theory. Another few weeks later did bile acid test, came back abnormal, high suspect for liver shunt at this point considering his now tiny stature compared to his brothers and clinical signs present without medicine. 
Called Hills nutritionist and got nutrition consult on what food to feed liver shunt kitten, considering hes developing, got recommended K/D (kidney care diet) as its low in protein and good for liver shunt cats. 

Ok. So hes got these two main issues. Now it's a few months later and I've paid his Bill's, and am now submitting his first claims to insurance. His heart was immediately denied because of the phone call I made to the company. They considered it part of his history as an owner diagnosis and thus put him back in the waiting period where it isn't covered. F**k. Ok, my bad, I screwed up. 

Now its been 3 weeks later and they've finally come back with a denial for his liver shunt, claiming, and I quote ""these signs would have been readily observable or reasonably know to be present before you enrolled"". So at 6 weeks old, my plump adorable visably healthy kitten should have been know to have a liver shunt. 

That. That last line is f**king ridiculous to me. I get I messed up by calling the company about his heart, but the liver shunt?!? How is anybody suppose to know their animal has a liver shunt when it's a baby?!? I'm a technician for heaven sake and I missed it until a few months later!!! Is an owner suppose to have medical foresight and say ""hey, my golden here is going to have cancer when its 5, and therefor wont be covered by insurance because I should have known""???? WHAT?!?

so the just of the whole thing is that i should have known all of the medical defects this fluffy white ball of cuteness should have had when he was 6 weeks old. And the insurance company has slimly gotten out of helping me with any of it. I thought I was all for insurance before this, but now I wouldn't recommend it to anybody unless it's a complete accident that happens to your pet, then it might be covered. But who knows, maybe you should have known your dog was going to get hit by a car, and then they wont cover you. 

I'm so mad. 
I don't even mind paying for his things, but the fact that they've intentionally tried to find ways to get out of it, all while taking my money monthly is the last straw.

366,366,"So, to start I am just going to say that I am 78% sure I am gay. I cant say that I am fully gay, because I feel like I want to have a wife and kids, because that's what everyone expects me to do, but at the same time I find some guys hot, others cute and I just want to be in a relationship with them. For now let's say I am gay. No one knows yet. Absolutely no one. I think that some of my very old friends suspect me, but I am not sure. Anyway I am at a new school for electronics. This is my first year in it and I think that most of my classmates are great. I already have some friends with which I am pretty close with. One of them is kinda acting gay, but I am not sure if he is gay, but we have a lot in common and we laugh quite a lot. I don't have any special feelings about him tho. We are in some kind or group together with another guy who I think is straight but I am not sure, cuz he hasn't shown all this much attention to girls or guys or anyone. So let's just call him the kinda straight guy. He is the one I am really into. He is veeeryyyy cute. I like the way he talks to everybody. He is very respectful, understanding and sweet. He also makes great jokes and I sometimes make him laugh too and most of the times the three of us, me, the kinda gay guy and the kinda straight guy, laugh a lot. I mean like a lot. I feel like the three of us are very good friends, but I just have some feelings about one of them that I have never had before. For example I like seeing that he is not perfect. I feel like his imperfections make him even cuter. And did I mention that he is really hot too. Omg. His body just looks soo good. I feel like I can watch him for hours and not get bored. But the thing that I really really like is when we make let's say eye contact or physical contact or anything that connects us in some type of way. I just feel these butterflies in my stomach which make me feel really cozy and protected. Also when I am not with him I always want to meet him again. And that encourages me to go to school every day with a smile on my faces, cuz I know I am going to see him and be with him all day. Ok, I am just going to stop, because I can talk about him all day and lets just say that I really like him and that I always imagine us as a couple. There is one last thing that I am going to say for him before I get to the main part. I feel like I dont deserve him. He just looks soo cute and hot and he is really sweet when he is talking with me or my friends. And when I think that I dont have a perfect body, I dont have a good looking face, my voice sounds kinda annoying... I think that when I stand up next to him people would think that we dont look good together and that I am ruining everything. But most of the times he distracts me from these type of thoughts with his smile and voice. Because I feel like I am not in a good physical form I really try to be sweet and energetic and helpful and kind and funny with everybody. I just think that if I am not going to be good at how I look I should be a very good friend. Doing this is really exhausting some times, but it just gives evidence to myself that I am a good person which makes me feel great and as I mentioned, just seeing his smile makes me feel like I can do anything. I can't think of another way to say this so I am just going to add that I like doing this, I like helping my friends and making them laugh and giving them energy, I dont want it to sound like I only do this to make people think I am a good friend. Ok, so let's finally get to the main part. So, I had to stay at home for about three weeks and not go to school, because of some health issues which are now solved and next week I will be able to go back to my normal life. Anyway for these three weeks I have been missing AALL my friends soo much. Especially the guy that I like. I just wanted to see them all and chat with them for like hours. I have been waiting for this moment for three weeks. At some point I just texted them that I miss them so much and that now I can go out. So we decided to go to the movies and then go around the city and talk. We went to avengers end game. The meet happened today. So we went to the movies and couldn't really talk, because I was busy organizing tickets and everything. I double checked if everybody is here and then we went to the movie. It was three hours long and when we got out it was about 6 o clock. Me the straight guy and two girls from our school decided to have a walk in the nearby park, because everyone else had other work and had to go after the movie. It is one of the biggest parks in our city. We went there and we talked, we laughed and everything. We had a really great time, but when we split and everyone went home I felt like the time wasn't enough. I just wanted to be with them all night and the next day too. But it is Easter and everyone is going in the country side. So I can't meet them for another 5 days. And because I just could not wait this long I decided to go to school earlier. And now as I am at home I just have this really strong desire to just hug him and hug him and hug him for hours. So I start thinking why didnt I do that. What can I do to hug him and not make him feel weird. He has not shown me any kind of sign that he likes me or anything, but I think today he was excited to see me too. All of these thoughts go through my mind and I am just confused what to do. I just really want to show him my feelings, but at the same time I dont want him to get scared and to ruin our whole friendship. I just don't know what to do. Should I tell him I am gay, but how. This could freak him out too. Will he understand that I am still the same person. Is there any chance that he will react positively. All of these questions go through my mind and I am just confused. This is not the first time I feel this way. When it happens I just try to think that I will see him soon and that he will make me feel good. I just need somebody to tell me what to do, cuz there is so much stuff to think about that our relationship just seems impossible, but at the same time I am optimistic about it. Sorry if the whole text is messed up and doesn't make good sense. I just needed to throw all of this somewhere. And it is like 1 am so I probably made a lot of mistakes writing this. So sorry about that too. At the end I feel like I am crazy.

I saw her after everyone else because I had to use the bathroom when I got there. 
When I came out, my heart broke in a way that only people who've gone through watching their loved one die can break.. she was so tiny, so pale, & thin. She looks so scared, so lost. I tried so hard not to cry, but I lost it. Just one, & a half weeks ago she looked like so much different. She wasn't this far gone. But cancer has taken my mom, & I can't deny any longer that we aren't getting her back. My younger brother is still in denial, I can't seem to help him see through it.

I feel like shit. Like in a nutshell that's it, but it's so much more at the same time.

&#x200B;

For example, I had my second maths mock today and literally cried my way through the exam. I was in my own room so it wasn't awkward or anything but still. I don't know if it was just stress or what. Or maybe it's because I got a U in my last one but I was fine for the whole day until before an hour before it when I literally started panicking despite revising and living in the college library. It's like I couldn't even comprehend the questions. I've cried so much that I feel like chundering. I tried to have a nap earlier and my heart rate just won't slow down. My eyes are sore and I feel like just giving up. Like, I feel like the only way I could've scored any worse on this test is if I literally shat on the paper and handed that in instead. 

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong; I won't kill myself. I'm too much of a p\*\*sy for that I've got things that I really, really want to achieve in this life before I die of old age and leave a fat old family behind me with so much money that they'll be able to figure out to buy happiness. Even that seems like it won't happen since I think I might be asexual. I just really want to reset my life and start again. Or college at the very least.

&#x200B;

And it's not like I'm stupid too. I'm fine in class. Homework is literal piss. But as soon as I sit down for a test, I'm fucked. It's like I didn't even revise. I know I can do really well but it's just not translating to exams. And because Micheal Gove the stupid prick decided that coursework was the biggest evil in the world, I can't even fall back on that.

The exfoliative cheilitis I have has destroyed the melanin cells around my lips and it's spreading. I look like a fucking gollywog or a Jim Crow character. I don't know if other people notice it but I sure as fuck do. Not to mention my fasciculations won't take a break. Every minute I feel some kind of tremor. I get them on the soles of my feet, my back, my scalp, my forehead, all places I never used to get them. They aren't too much of a problem; they even feel kind of nice but still. I've had a headache for the past week now and my abdomen hurts when I wake up and sometimes when I move in a weird way. 

&#x200B;

I've got so many hobbies that I want to undertake and I know they would improve my life so much but I feel like I've got no motivation. I believe in the law of attraction and follow the teachings of Neville Goddard (among others) and the Bible too and felt recently that my mind was what was limiting me so I've taken up listening to affirmations as I fall asleep which definitely reset my mood but I feel that by the end of the day, despite achieving the majority of what I wanted to, that I've wasted the day away. And I'll probably find something else to cry about once this has been posted but, what's said has been said.

So I?ll be bringing a human into the world in a few months (yay!) and while this is amazing and brings me so much joy I can?t help but feel a growing sense of overwhelming grief and uselessness. Ever since I found I was pregnant everything negative in my life just kinda intensified. I guess I?ll share a few of these things and see if anyone could maybe give me some advice or kind words, thank you in advance for reading. 

1. Life at home is a misery. Since I?m 17, I?m still living with my mum and step dad. I have two half siblings, 7 and 5. Mum is the most amazing and kind hearted person you could ever meet and had been incredibly supportive, however she is not without her flaws. She is kind of a borderline hoarder. It?s not like what you see on the tv with like dead rats in the corner and newspapers piled high, the house is clean but there?s a LOT of stuff. Things like clothes and stuffed animals and things like that she gets attached to and never gets rid of. she?s constantly buying more stuff and there?s just no room for it. It spills out into my room too, so for the 8 years that I?ve lived in this house with my mum and step dad I?ve never had a room to myself. It?s like a storage unit. 

Brother and sister have a kind heart but are really spoilt and it?s beginning to show. They don?t care about any of their stuff and their attitudes are really out of line. What breaks my heart is that they seem pretty miserable too, and they?re only kids. And most of that misery comes from my step dad.

If I had to use the word hate to describe my feelings towards anyone, it would be him. He wasn?t meant to be a dad. He?s fucking useless. Didn?t have a girlfriend til he met my Mum at the age of 30. Lived with his parents and let them do everything for him. When my mum had her first kid with him, (7 year old girl) just after giving birth the first thing he said to her was ?oh I guess we?ll try again? (he wanted a boy.) At the age of 10 I had changed one of my infant half sisters nappies before he had. As both kids have grown up he?s taken no part in actively bringing them up, he?ll do the bare essentials like feeding them in the evenings when he gets home from work.  Even that he complains about it and screams at me if I haven?t fed and dressed them by the time he gets back. He has no communication skills. His own kids mock and ignore him because they have zero respect. He?s pretty abusive too. He?s never lifted a hand to me but will verbally abuse me and make sure I know I?m not part of their perfect family.   However the kids he will hit. And not a small slap on the leg like I had as a kid, he will pick them up and smack them until they cry. 

Mum knows he?s out of order but keeps believing him when he says he?s gonna change. For 2 years they haven?t slept in the same bed as eachother because he lets the youngest sleep in their double bed with him since the kids really clingy. and mum sleeps in a bunk bed with my sister.  There?s literally no affection and she came really close to divorcing him but she backed out once again because she?s too scared to be alone and we need the financial stability, especially now. 

2. Family is fake. One of the few reasons my mum married him was because she loved his family so much. They seemed like the exact opposite to him and were absolute sweethearts to me when I was younger. However this pregnancy has brought out their true colours. His mum basically shamed me behind my back and to my mum and blamed her for it and said I?d ruined my future by having this baby and that I should have aborted. She?s caused a huge divide and none of them are the people I thought they were.

My mums parents on the other hand are amazing and have supported me, and loved me and treated me with no less affection than they had previously. I love them so fucking much and they really are the one stable thing in my life. Part of the heartache is that god is fucking cruel and we not long found out that my nan has been diagnosed with cancer. So that sucks too and has taken a big toll on my emotions. I can?t lose her.

3. My boyfriend. I feel like the whole pregnancy had brought us so much closer together, despite him not wanting me to keep it he has remained with me and supported me. However I still worry about the future of our relationship because of this. Will he come to resent us? He comes to my appointments and insists he?s gonna be there for the birth which really warms my heart and I love him for that and showing so much care, but at the same time, especially recently, he keeps reminding me he didn?t want it. I don?t know why he?s doing it, whether he?s panicking as it comes closer or there?s an underlying thing of him just not being happy about it. But he seemed fine and I don?t know why he?d be this supportive if he didn?t want it. I feel useless, like I?m going to ruin his life and he?s going to hate me. I don?t want this kid to feel unwanted because of me. 

There?s just so much going on, I also have these big exams coming up and I just haven?t revised at all for them. I don?t have anything around me that makes me want to motivate myself. I try to think how it will benefit my kid by me doing well but I just, can?t. I can?t do it anymore. I feel so stuck.

Some backstory.

We had this dance for our school (here where I live, we have this school system where it was first elementary school, ages 7-13 and Upper level, ages 13-16 etc.) in upper class where it was kinda like disco/dance party, that is organized by the student council. I went there with my friends from my class, and a class below us. We had fun, danced and had cake and drinks. So when there was the first slow dance, and my lower classmate decided, that his female friend should dance with me. so we went and danced. That kinda became a thing. We danced on every slow dance (there were like 5, idk why). In between dances, I noticed my friend, that later tried to commit suicide, was just standing with her friends, they seemed lonely, especially her. I thought nothing of it at first. 

When me and the the below class friend danced, I noticed her again, she looke very anxious, and lonely, but still was with hee friends, in the edge of the dance floor. I just saw something, something in her felt off, it felt like this was apart of her reason, I should have asked her to dance, she would have had a better night, and her seeing me dance with another girl, and seeing how I didn't like her enough that I would ask her to dance. might have be the reason, or apart of the reason.

After the night, I maybe had feelings for the below class girl. The next day, I really thought about it, and decided, that it wasn't actual atraction, just in the heat of the moment stuff. The relationship between me, and the below class girl, never really became anything, and we both agreed that it wasn't anything special.

I was thinking about her (my friend who is currently in the hospital), and thought about what I had done. I felt bad, but even more bad, when she sent the picture, of her in the hospital.

We talked back and forth a bit, and I asked her if I could go see her, she said she we ask the nurses, and will tell me if it's possible.

After we talked, I pieced everything together, and thought about  how my actions might have caused the suicide attempt, or be apart of the reason. I felt really terrible, and bad for her.

However, it?s been a little over a year since I broke up with my ex girlfriend because she cheated on me before I started university. Since then, I?ve not had the greatest luck with women and it?s really starting to get to me because a lot of my friends are speaking to girls and guys and are managing to build a relationship with them at university.

I was going through the semester and barely keeping up, and eventually started falling behind. Looking forward to the final papers, I knew I couldn?t make it. I had two anxiety attacks in two days, and knew that I had to withdraw from a class to save the others. Better to get a passing grade in two classes than fail two or three.

I found out that I couldn?t withdraw without owing thousands of dollars from a scholarship. Talking to my wife and parents, they offered to help with outlines and research. It?s helpful, but it?s not enough.

I do some research, and find out that I will not owe anything if I fail the class. I also will not be in academic probation because my GPA is otherwise high enough. I hesitated because it could potentially hurt me if I ever pursue another degree, but decide that taking an extra semester of school will allow me to excel in my classes instead of drown this entire semester.

387,387,"I've never been real close to my brother, especially in the past five or six years I've known him. No one in my family is close though, so I didn't think much of it. It feels more like we're all roommates who will eventually move out.

My bro never hugged me, never responded when I told him stuff like ""love you be safe"", never left his room when he was home. I never saw him around, but again, it's pretty much just me on my own in this house. It didn't look like he was going to graduate high school despite being an incredibly smart guy. I always thought he'd be the first to go to college. He didn't care when my mom screamed at him, never cried, wasn't really home much.

In the span of a few weeks last December, his life sorta came crumbling down. The school counselor called our parents. I don't know what she told them. No one tells me anything and I'm just trying to keep my head down and not intrude in other people's business. I'm barely staying afloat myself. A few days later, he started randomly crying in front of my mom while they were in the car together. I have NEVER seen this boy cry in my life. When she commented on it, he said that life had no purpose. He didn't know any of his friends even though he went out with them every night. He felt like he didn't have a connection with anyone on earth.

She was disturbed but didn't do anything. At this point, he was coming home at all hours of the night, if at all, and wouldn't tell anyone where he'd been. He did show me some mild drug paraphernalia and humblebrag about doing coke with his friends, but I know that has been going on for years since I was in middle school. I got used to his absence like everyone else's in my life.

One night a week later, he and my dad got into a fistfight, which has never happened before. My dad is a great guy and very mild mannered, so when he gets angry it's downright terrifying. My bro didn't care. He screamed at them about wanting to kill himself and went out.

He went to a psychiatrist. My mom despises shrinks and doesn't trust doctors. She mentioned that he shouldn't go, but I think some part of her was really worried for him. Not even years of disinterest and neglectful boredom could dig out the little motherly piece of her heart. I don't know what he was diagnosed with but they gave him zombie drugs and sleeping medication and told him to eat more, get brain scans and blood tests, and go to therapy. He weighed 127 lbs at 6'4"". I don't know how he was alive. I didn't realize. I don't know if people knew but didn't care. I'm not sure who he knows that would ask about his weight.

The last few months he has gotten better. He works on real cars now and knows everything there is to know about them. He's pretty obsessed with machine parts and such. He still goes out some nights but he always comes home at night. It's stupid but I can't go to sleep until I hear the door opening downstairs. I didn't realize how close I was to losing my brother in the most horrible way. Letting him slip away from me almost killed him. I didn't know any different.

I got into college today. Gonna be the first one in my family to go. First thing he said to me was: ""[my college]? I read an article this morning that said that was number one worst in the US."" I laughed but in reality I felt like shit. I'd been working my ass off grinding for the SAT, taking overload of classes that kept me up all hours of the night, running miles in XC, writing damn novels for Model UN, and every other bit of grinding for college admissions. I'd graduated two years early, gotten my diploma, been accepted into a great college all by myself. No one in my family really knows what I'm up to or where I'm going. I was so excited to tell SOMEONE that I made it and all he did was tell me that.

So I sucked it up and went to get a snack from the kitchen. He walked with me and he told me, ""That's cool though, congrats."" He let me hug him although he kept his arms down at his sides. I hadn't hugged him in YEARS. I haven't hugged anyone in years because although I have friends, it's weird to hug your friends. It felt so good, like some bit of him was shining through. I forgot what he was truly like.

I'm leaving for college now and I won't see him for a few years. Maybe for a really long time, depending on how things go. He won't call and I don't think I will either. What would we talk about? I might stick around this summer so I can be around him a bit more before we part ways.

I feel love for him but everyone around me is so stiflingly apathetic. I just feel lost. I want a human connection.

Work has been eating at me for five years. A co-worker(A) (F50) drives me (30F) nuts. I feel I do a great job. I feel I go above and beyond, I do my best to go out of my way to have happy customers. I'm kind of anti-social, I get nervous when talking, I'd rather just do my job and go. My co-worker (A) is much more of a people person. It's to a point where I personally feel like customers prefer her just for the small talks.


If anything goes wrong she blames me. One day she was accused of stealing an item, she tried to flip it saying that I could've had it planned. I was so dumbfounded at her reaction, I have a job so I can afford to buy things I need or want, that's the point of having a job. I'm fairly certain she (A) would never steal from anyone. We have had a handful of past accusations, I assume from customers who just wanted a way out of their contracts with our company, as they've never followed through with proof, police, or lawyers. Just service cancellation.


Co-worker (A) always has some backhanded response to say to me, especially when we're alone. She makes it a point to tell me how to do my job, when I'm one of the three that trained her. We've had to go back to a job just because SHE missed a spot in an area that was hers, and it was clearly visible. I hardly ever point out her mistakes, when I do it's to say ""hey, Idk if you can see it from that angle, but from where I'm standing i can see (insert what and where)"" I usually just fix it when I see it, in my opinion that's the point of teamwork and being a team player, plus I don't want her to feel like I don't trust her to do her job. She makes comments that I take too long when I'm working, yet she'll have plenty left to do while I'm finishing up my work and checking over myself, occasionally she pawns her leftover work on me and takes over what I'm doing which is our end process. We are supposed to finish our separate tasks and finish up. There are some instances where she does one area of her tasks, I do mine, the rest of hers, because she rather get a jump on the finishing up bit. It drives me insane. Why can't you just do what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it?!



The best part though, the boss doesn't know, well the boss might expect it, just because (boss) has made a single comment to me before about this co-worker A. Some of the other co-workers have also made comments about this co-worker, but I don't respond to them, because when it comes down to it, I still have to work with her. I don't like confrontation and I've been holding all of this in for so long. Well until a couple days ago,  I worked with another coworker (B), one on one, her and I are a bit closer in age, and confide in each other every now and then as we both have depression. We spoke a lot. Come to find out that same coworker (A) has been making remarks about her too, completely throwing her (B) under the bus when she's not even around to defend herself.



One of the upper management workers even told me, to my face ""you're so sweet, I love you, but (co-worker A) I hate her! Idk why, but I can't stand her!""


It just feels like co-worker A is manipulative, her way or the highway type of persona, and it makes me feel crazy, even though I've personally heard it from at least 5 people (since December 2018 alone!) that they ""get a weird vibe from her"" and one (not the upper management worker) said ""I'm not too sure about co-worker A""

I guess I will cut ties with the one I am dating, I guess I will stop answering some of my friends and my parents. I think what I really need to do is focus fully on my own self-improvement.

404,404,"I have been at my lab tech job a few years now. It has caused me severe anxiety being in such a fast paced lab. It was my first ""real"" job out of school and I'm pretty sure its the root cause of all my low self-esteem and everything, minus things I have listed before. This week almost did me in. I come to work Monday evening and there is already a crisis with a missing sample we needed as soon as possible. I was given the task of finding the simple in the walk in fridge. We needed it like ASAP and I spent an hour putting everything on carts looking for it...turns out it was in the wrong spot. Fucking idiots from the day shift. I had to put everything back as well. Took almost 7 hours of my shift to do. I than had to write another two hour incident report of what all happened since this was a major event as it delayed patient care so long. Finally after almost 10 hours I get home and crash hard already dreading the next day. Alarm goes off to the same..slept till almost 2..never do that. I get to work and surprise surprise we have an internal audit which we get every year or so. This includes watching things like releasing patient results really any of our daily tasks. Well it gets better, I get extremely nervous being watched and guess who they picked to watch, me! So I had to go print our procedure for the task (which I do daily) but when you're getting audited... everything has to be perfect. So the specific task they wanted to see me do was maintenance on one of our automation devices which is usually a simple and quick thing. I just pull the front panels off this calibrator, swab for dust and put it back and sign I did it on the daily log. SO yeah I printed the procedure and was following it word for word. All of a sudden the auditor stops me and told me I forgot to sign the initial and date section when the task was completed. Its called concurrent documentation, you literally have to check the task when its complete and this was the last step and I forgot to freaking check it and initial it. Well I got written for ""being observed breaking procedure due to unsigned date, signature and check box which violates procedure when it comes to concurrent documentation"". I now have to attend this meeting next week to discuss why I broke procedure. Its normally not a big deal and would be considered clerical but because it was observed by an auditor its a bigger deal. SO that happened all before my day even started. Another crazy shift and again, last hour I find a huge mistake another lab tech made and could have been a huge problem if not caught...was required to write these things up...I went and grabbed the individual and the person was virtually begging me not to write her up as she was already performing poorly. It was really up to me because I could just cut it off and not say anything and no one would notice. Only the two of us would know. She begged me for like 20 minutes as I was pacing back and forth trying to think about what to do. I finally just said fine cut the tag off and walked away. That all happened it two days, I just feel so horrible about what I did because now I sacrificed patient safety over tech cover up.. In the rush, I didn't want her to get in trouble because I know she is trying, it wasn't a huge thing...basically if anyone finds out what the both of us did we will both get fired. I am guilt ridden, angered at being written up and just the overall pressure I feel at that this place daily. Its soul draining. I have no plans though if I just up and quit and it isn't exactly easy to find new jobs in my little town.

405,405,"I know this guy probably won?t ever see this but today I had my faith in humanity restored.... 

In a nutshell my Husband lost his job several months ago and things have been really tight. To the point of counting change to keep our basic utilities on (electric, gas, rent) and keep our animals fed and cared for - they come first in our eyes <3 

However, my Husband started a new job a couple of weeks ago and things are finally looking up, he was told today he?s going to get a raise and more hours too! But we are still barely scraping by because obviously first couple of paychecks were small. 

Today went to the store and spent the last $15 dollars till payday (tomorrow) on dog & cat food for our animals. And had $4.00 left over to throw in the gas tank. But when I got out of the car at the gas station I realized I must have dropped 2 dollars some where but the odds of finding it or getting it back are slim especially if I dropped it in a parking lot. So I found .50 cents in the car and figured well a gallon of gas should be just enough till he gets paid. I work for myself doing house cleaning (just started my own business) but $ from that isn?t consistent it all depends on how many houses I do that week and what I do. 

When I went out to pump the gas the attendant let me know another customer threw in a few more dollars. I know that it doesn?t seem like that big of a deal but Im not the type to ask for a hand out or look for sympathy from others, our mess isn?t their responsibility. But that simple gesture meant more than the man that threw in the extra few dollars knows.... He was truly our guardian angel in disguise and lifted a huge worry off my shoulders. 

I did go back in and thank him for doing that but I feel like that wasn?t enough. Maybe through the powers of Redditors he might see this and I just wanted to say thank you again to him - You were a complete stranger and did this out of the kindness of his heart. Because of you I didn?t have anxiety all night worrying if I would have just enough gas or would I end up stranded on the side of the road. You restored my faith in humanity... Thank you so much again!

Born 1986, February, my mother was informed of a likely placental abruption and waited until after Valentine's day as she had a meal planned for my father, born 6 weeks early.

&#x200B;

As a very young baby my father in a drunken rage held me up by my throat and threatened to the street demanding did they want to see a dead baby, (source Police record), I was a quiet child, impeccably behaved and mannered. My mother had twins when I was around 3 years old, one died from meningitis at 6 weeks of age, one was adopted by the foster carer who had looked after us for a time. I was returned to my mother. I was such a good child.

&#x200B;

Aged 4 I was in the hospital with hypoglycaemia, my birthday was spent in the hospital, the nurses were lovely, and I remember the rocking horse in the playroom being so big, the ladybird ride-on toy that I coveted. The being held down for blood tests, the being alone as my mother had to work so couldn?t make the visits. I didn?t mind, and I was so well behaved.

&#x200B;

At 5 years old I asked my step-father to be my new daddy, it was very cute apparently, I wore a pink dress to their wedding and had my hair specially plaited. Two nights later I was in the hospital after ?falling? onto the corner of the skirting board because I asked for water. I was very quiet and said exactly what I had been told to the doctor as they stitched my head.

&#x200B;

I remember staying with my grandparents a lot, my mums parents let me drink sweet milky tea and watch the kids shows on the TV, my step-fathers had a magnificent garden with parsley plants and my grandi in the garage working with wood, I can remember the taste and the smell, the bathroom with all the bottles so pretty. I was quiet and well behaved so I was allowed out with the neighbour's children. These are my only happy memories in childhood. The taste of scotch rolls and square sausage.

&#x200B;

At aged 6 we suddenly moved from Scotland to England, Highcliffe, no reason was given to me but we just upped and moved, I remember the argument before getting in the car, my grandma desperately trying to stop them taking me. We camped in the New Forest for a time, I was well behaved and neglected, my parents started drinking, I would leave in the morning and come back to the tent in the evening, playing feral all day. But I was always well behaved, I knew the consequences for punishment. I remember being forced to eat Smash and Mince every night, the smell the taste, not being allowed to move until it was gone. Lunch was a Jam sandwich, Breakfast was sugar puffs and a tiny amount of milk, as it was needed for tea throughout the day.

&#x200B;

We got a place at a hostel type place that was on top of a tyre shop, I loved it and would be outside all day playing in the tyres, climbing in them and generally staying out the way. I had to do my homework next to the TV and I was always told how I had to be better than the English. I remember getting the belt for getting upset at not knowing how big a pea was but the dentist had told me to use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and I was desperate for the answer I asked twice. I was scared of going to the shared communal bathroom so often had UTI?s. I was a quiet, well-behaved child, no bother. Seen and not heard, or preferably not seen either.

&#x200B;

At age 8 or so I began to notice how much they drank, how dangerous they were when they drank, we moved to Bashley Park, a caravan site, my step-father was the warden there. I was groomed by a member of the swimming pool, an old man with Parkinson?s, Eddy. He made me sit on his lap in the sauna, I still panic at the smell of eucalyptus and wood. When I told my mother that I didn?t want to go to his house and help him, I was beaten. When I left a condom in his bed to try and get help after telling on me to my parents that I had broken something and their subsequent punishment, he took me to the woods and made me swallow it before leaving me to walk back. My mother?s mental health started to deteriorate, she attempted suicide many times, I had to watch her attempts whilst being told it is my fault or clean up the blood. I was neglected, I started to steal leftovers from the restaurant after people had left their plates. The staff stared silently but mercifully didn?t say anything. Due to concerns raised by the school and my mother?s admittance to the hospital, I went to foster care. I was well behaved, desperate for attention and affection. I would stay a few months before going back to my mother for a few months. It was always my fault, I should have died not my sister.

&#x200B;

This pattern continued to repeat until aged 12, on my birthday I got sent makeup by my grandma, I was overjoyed. I applied it with all the tact of a face painter, bright blue eyeshadow and bright red lips. When I got home from going out my step-father caught me with it on, he told me I was asking for it and taught me exactly what I was asking for. He smashed my makeup before raping me. I was silent. Telling on him would just earn me more pain, I had learnt that lesson well.

&#x200B;

At secondary school, I got in trouble for stealing food, I was in even more trouble when I got home. I wasn?t allowed to eat with them, I was called disgusting and an animal so had to eat like one. My step-father still continued to use me whenever my mother was not there, or when she was too drunk to notice what was happening in front of her. I was quiet, a loner with no friends, but easy as I would do whatever the boys told me, desperate for attention and affection in any place I could find it. I was dumped at the Social Services building and told they would put me in a children?s home or something.

&#x200B;

At aged 14 nearly 15, I was caught stealing food again, I was told by them that they would be beating me every day after school, as I hadn?t learnt my lesson, grounded indefinitely, I ran away during the night. It took two weeks before the school asked if everything was alright at home. I laughed and said I didn?t live there anymore. I had been using my Army Cadet Training to live in the woods near the school. I hadn?t been reported missing by my parents.

&#x200B;

I never returned home, they didn?t bother to visit, I have moved around in foster homes, unable to form any meaningful attachments and with an annoying habit of hoarding and stealing food.

At college, I met my ex, my knight in shining armour who saved me from foster care, before turning into my jailer. So many red flags that I wasn?t able to recognise. Of course he told me what to wear, he cared about me, of course, he was entitled to pleasure when he wanted, he saved me. At age 18 we were married, at 19 I was pregnant, and at 20 I was pregnant again. Then his behaviour became overtly abusive, controlling the amount of petrol in the car so I could only do the school run, no access to money or freedom, emotionally whipping me. I began to lose myself in World of Warcraft, I made friends with a few people, had a little hope that I was part of a world that actually accepted me. He split up with me when he got together with his now wife, the person I called in tears just hoping that she could make him happy because I was never good enough. I slept in the children?s room or on the Sofa for a year before I was able to move out.

Aged 0-26 I experienced every kind of abuse, at aged 27 I had the first relationship I had ever had that was unconditionally loving, we met on World of Warcraft. We have had a child together who is now 2, I have continued to battle my ex at court.

I have done my best to heal and grow and to attempt to protect the boys from experiencing anything as I had experienced. But it has impacted them, my mental health scars, have impacted them more than they should. I have had to make the hardest ever decision to allow my ex to win and have the children live with him so that I can be their mum and not let them feel like they need to look after me.

My mental health is so poor I am unable to work, but I am studying for an Open Uni degree in Psychology, having never been successful in education. I have panic attacks if I have to speak on the phone to someone new or anyone comes too close to me. I am vastly overweight and it is damaging my health, but I still can't control myself not to eat everything in sight as my body knows what it is like to starve far too frequently.

I have been taking my medication regularly for the first time ever, but its been 6 months and the only therapy I have been given is mindfulness. I am self-harming again, superficially as it is easier to deal with the physical pain than the emotional. I am on the verge of suicidal thoughts but not set a date yet. I don't want to pass the pain onto the children, that's the only thing that stops me acting on it. But they don't need me damaging their lives even more than I already have.

My ex girlfriend( we will refer to her as M) and I have been together for seven years and throughout these years we would be on and off again but those were as breaks and not as break ups and we always checked on each other and chat up a bit every few days. On the end of 2017 she was posting on her IG stories about love and her being hurt, I messaged her what she was talking about and that it?d be better if she?d talk to me about it.  She told me that we needed to take some break and I respected that and weeks later she told me we needed to break up and when asked for reasons she mentioned some old arguments that we?ve already solved and I tried to reason but it was to no avail so I thought this can?t be that serious and thought it was one of our on and offs. 

I?d check her WhatsApp and she?d keep changing her profile pictures to pictures of here which were pretty ones and mostly pictures that define her body(you know them attractive poses) and some that were of her thighs, before she only used to change her profile picture after months and they?d be casual pictures of her face or random images from the internet. A week has passed and I?ve not heard from her but the pictures were being updated almost every two to three days so I called her and I asked her if this was really the end of us and she said yes and that I?ve to move on and I asked her if she did and she said she did move on, so I respected that and let her be. She removed me from her social media followers (except WhatsApp because she hates blocking) and that?s when I realised that that was the end of us. The arbitrary break up didn?t make sense to me so I went and asked her if she was talking to anyone, she said no and I asked her if she was dating anyone to which she said no and that I?ve to stop talking to her and move on. So I stopped talking to her.  


M had a public account and a private account. She only uses the private account with her girl friends, even her male best friend is not accepted there. Two weeks had passed since she called things out and I decided to check her IG to see how she was doing and one comment caught my eyes and it was a new guy she never mentioned and he complimenting her which is nothing but something felt fishy about it and I went to his profile and looked up his followings and he was following her Private account. I guessed she had already moved on and started dating him. Told my friends that that might have been planned beforehand and they told me I?m exaggerating and she can?t do that. After a month, right before me going to sleep she texted me around 1 am (she only stays up this late to talk on video calls) saying if she can please talk to me and I told her she can. I?ll change up the format so it?d be easier for you guys to read:

Her: I did something wrong and I don?t think you?ll forgive me for it

Me: If you want to tell me, tell me most probably I?d forgive you 

Her: I was dating a guy and I think he?s mentally ill (and goes on to tell me about him and the stories and asks me how to avoid him)

Me: (gave her some advices and tips) and asked her when they started dating..?

She mentioned the day, and that day was before I asked her if she was talking to anyone.

Me: So when I asked you about that, you lied to me?

Her: Yes

Me: You didn?t have to lie, why did you jump into a relationship real quick though? Rebound?

Her: No, he made me feel special

After that I started blaming myself because I was going through lots of stress due to long-awaited finals and that way I might?ve gave her less attention.


We got back together I don?t remember how and we both were happy like before she started to change negatively and this led to us not being happy like before and I talked to her about us and that we need to do better and she?d just ignore that as if it wasn?t important. Weeks later she called things off just like how we used to do years ago. Months later I texted her asking her if she?d still want us together then we must start improving everything from now because later on she might not be able as I was going abroad. She dismissed that as it meant nothing. I still kept telling her about it and how important it was if she still wanted us together, but no she?d not agree to it and she?d not disagree with it. We?d still behave as we were together though, nothing strange.

Two months later I?m away from and her birthday was approaching so I made her a present and to make it fun I made some steps that she has to follow which would lead her to the present. Guys I?m not exaggerating but that was the cutest and most creative thing I?ve ever done and heard about.  I didn?t tell her that they?d lead to the present though, I never mentioned her birthday for months so she?d think I forgot and later be surprised by the present. I kept reminding her to do them a week earlier and when the day came I reminded her again and she said she?d make sure to do them. 


She was out the whole day celebrating her birthday and I decided to hang out with my friends. I received a text from her and I thought it?d be her being happy about the present but instead she was angry that I hadn?t wished her HBD, I asked her if she did what I told her to do, she said she didn?t and I asked her why and her reason was because she forgot and then I told her if she had not forgotten she would?ve seen that I didn?t forget her birthday(I never did, she forgot mine three times). It doesn?t end there, she said I should?ve thought about ?what if she had forgotten to check?. I know for fact it wasn?t because she forgot, it was because she never listens to me.

I have nowhere I feel comfortable bringing this and in doing so it might backfire in my face like so many times before. But I need to do this.

I broke down today. After everything I have been through and today it was finally too much. Today all the therapy and medications just couldn't keep it at bay any longer. 

&#x200B;

I've been raised by an abusive mother and step-father. I have an achingly distant relationship with my father that I have tried to remedy in the past but to no avail. I didn't go to college and use my gift of learning to its full advantage. I have instead decided to fill the void of feeling unworthy and unloved by pleasing others. This has led to further despair. Now I am a doormat. I feel so insignificant even in my daily life of being a spouse, parent, and employee. I have had success with marriage and parenting, yes. Maybe that's why I have always repressed what is now bursting forth because I feel like others have it worse. So I have no right to this pain.

&#x200B;

I have come so far, yet still filled with so much anger and pain. My mother doesn't love me. My father likes to be alone. I have lost so many friends, new and old. My job is nothing fulfilling and daily I feel like I am 13, emotionally and perceptively. Whenever I speak I am ridiculed, ignored, or yelled at. It sounds like an exaggeration, I know. But it's the truth. I am treated as nothing. An unimportant child. Even by strangers on the internet.

&#x200B;

The things I enjoy and love are ridiculed. So I feel stupid. Standing up for myself doesn't work as it leads to scorn or humiliation.  I am always ordered around and told what to do. Nobody, not even my nephews who I happen to be watching tonight (begrudgingly) listen to me. There is something about me that is so flawed. There must be. When I look inward, I see a kind and loyal person. I truly don't want to hurt anyone and often just want to help. Yet nobody outside my spouse seems to care or accept me.

&#x200B;

It was a stupid song that finally did it. I just crumbled to my knees and cried so hard I got dizzy. I thought of all the talent of words and writing I wish I had so I could express myself fully. I thought of my envy of writers and musicians. And I just cried for hours. I am so lonely and in pain. I am rejected by everyone I've talked to for my hobbies, likes, demeanor, or true self.  I don't know who else to be. I don't know what they want me to like and not like. I don't know what is acceptable in their eyes anymore.  But I can't pretend. This is me. All soft-hearted, shy, loving, hopelessly romantic me. And I just want to be accepted.

Dear Philly,

I've spent 5 years of my life living here and I  can't stand you any longer. People seem to think that you're this delightful town, rich in cultural and historical significance. But I know the truth...that you're  actually a landfill cleverly disguised as a place suitable for human  habitation. Lemme just take a moment to list everything about you that  everyone should know before they even consider driving past you on 95  while they're making their way to a better place.

1. **Your murals are detestably bad.**  I don't know what kind of satanic blood sacrifice MuralArts had to do in order to get their stranglehold on the mural rights here, but jesus christ they straight up ruin my day with how shitty they are. If i have  to see one more mural of some asshole looking hopefully at the sky or  planting a tree, I'm going to splatter it with red paint. Here's a crazy  idea...how about you hire actual artists to paint shit that doesn't fit into the ""hopeful for the future because the present fucking sucks"" theme? I pass the stupid Kevin Hart ""live laugh love"" mural every day and it makes me hate myself for moving here.
2. **You are just covered in garbage.**  You are by far the filthiest town I've ever seen. The littering culture  here is astounding, with people going OUT OF THEIR WAY to throw their  garbage down the storm drains...Not that they really need to anyway  since you lack any semblance of a street sweeping program and the  garbage ALWAYS finds its way into the watershed. Part of my job is to teach people gardening, and every time we meet we have to devote 25 mins  to checking the ground for heroin needles and full on bags of garbage. I've seen someone scold his little brother for littering on the  basketball court (hooray!) only to then tell him to throw his trash into  the street instead (aw..) I give it 5 years before Philadelphians go full Victorian-era London and just start dumping their shit out of their  windows.
3. **You fetishize your own shittiness.**  I swear to god people here have mass-Stockholm Syndrome. I can't count  how many times I've heard some dipshit say something to the effect of  DURRRR WE MIGHT NOT BE PRETTY BUT WE'RE BLUE COLLAR AND WE GOT HEART DURRRR. Newsflash! You can be a respectable blue collar town while  trying to actually improve your quality of life. You can take pride in  where you come from while ALSO acknowledging its debilitating problems  and working to solve them. An endless parade of homeless addicts and  billowing trash does not equal ""having heart."" It just means I can't  walk around town with my visiting family without them getting concerned about what direction my life is going.
4. **Your food sucks.**  Sorry to be the one to break this to you, and I know it may come as a  shock, but warmed up pretzels and stupid cheesy sandwiches are not cool foods. People been doing that shit everywhere for approximately one trillion years. Of all the city-specific foods, yours are by far the  god damn stupidest. Any other town has at least ONE amazing food that  people should actually be proud of. San Diego has incredible Mexican   and seafood, KC has legendary BBQ, New York has insanely good and cheap  pizza, Baltimore has steamed crabs, and you dumped shitty cheese on a meat. Fuck you.
5. **Your roads dude...**  Jesus tits every time I drive to work I feel like I'm navigating the  pummeled surface of Earth's moon. I've murdered my car on the same  stretches of road so many times that I've started to give the potholes  names. Don't fill them in at this point; I've grown too attached.
6. **The ""Love"" statue**  I just can't help but imagine the amount of time and money spent trying  to figure out what sort of amazing art or statue you're going to  display at the heart of the city in the middle of its most accessible  plaza. You're sweating out board meetings, voting on countless  submissions, and grinding away because you know art is important and  this is something that people are going to see for years to come.  Suddenly some dick in the back of the room raises a trembling hand and  goes ""what if its like...the word love but we rotate the O like 20  degrees..?"" You all erupt in cheers and take turns suckling his limp,  feeble penis because you think the best kind of art for the center of  your city is something that is entirely unoffensive and says nothing of  import.
7. **Your inhabitants are angry and weird**.  Trust me I do not mean this in an endearing way like ""aw shucks that's  just our cranky uncle Joe but he's really a sweetheart."" Nah man...you  people are fucking WEIRD and aggressive. NOT in a cool way. I saw a dude  absolutely lay on his horn because he was trying to make a right turn  and an elderly woman had the AUDACITY to use the crosswalk. I was in  Wawa's yesterday, and this old lady straight up said ""I hate those  f\*\*\*\*ts that be playin sports with normal people. I hope those f\*\*\*\*ts all die."" and 5  other people chimed in with ""You know that's right DURR"" You riot when  you're mad, you riot when you're happy, and you will straight up gouge  someone with a broken Yuengling bottle if they dare insult your precious  fucking eagles. It's sports man... fucking chill. You're a bizarre, unhappy people and you project your city's many failures onto others.

I  could go on, but I can feel my blood pressure doing mean things to my  heart. I hate you, Philly, and you deserve the inferiority complex you  have because you are, in fact, inferior. Inferior to other cities,  inferior to spiders, inferior to everything. Your sister city should be Fallujah at the height of American invasion. I'd wish a plague upon you except you're already rife with cockroaches and jehovahs witnesses.

I basically started working at my dream job 4 years ago ? it was a sort of demotion but better pay, and a much better chance of progressing further than my previous employment. It was a fantastic four years, we made a product that was critically successful but not financially, so come middle of 2018 we weren't in a great state, but we were all confident as we had an amazing team, the culture was fantastic ? never in my life have I ever worked somewhere where I had more friends than I did colleagues, seriously a dream job.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to six months ago, it's announced internally that we're being acquired by a MUCH larger company ? naturally, there were concerns from everyone, but management assured us that one of the deals they made was to keep the team together ? which made sense, as that's the one thing that made what we had spectacular, we just didn't have the funding to take it to the next level and become global. Everyone was happy, except my department which started to become concerned, in the fact that this massive company had their own place off-country who dealt with my area of work ? now, those concerns were rested by current management as they explained, we're all being retrained in new fields over the course of the next couple of years, as they knew us all so well, and that our jobs were just one small part of why we were at the company ? as I keep saying, it was a fantastic bunch, everyone was really talented, so they needed to keep that.

&#x200B;

So they have me work with some of the management ? which by the way, one specific task they asked me to do, I did specifically down to the finest detail, alongside an expert they hired to ensure we did it correctly, just to have said management to completely delete my progress, redo it his way, and expect me to present it the next day... I'm given some further responsibilities of varying degrees, that annoyingly I can't express otherwise it may become obvious as to what I do or maybe even where I work... frankly I was becoming a massive asset to the company.

&#x200B;

Cut to a few days ago and I get pulled into a meeting by my boss, along with a load of other people, who could barely look us in the eye to tell us we're all being made redundant. Frankly, none of us could believe it, and I'm so fucking angry because somewhere along the chain of command, someone has been lying ? I spoke to him, HR, numerous other people saying when we were taken over ?I'm concerned about being let go?, constantly assured this won't be the case ? the fact is, I had multiple offers during this time for work, and I turned it down because I was being told we were a valued department regardless.

&#x200B;

But it's my fault ? I found this place, I loved it too much, I believed in their bullshit forgetting that at the end of the day, it's a company, it's a business. I never should have trusted anyone there, and here I am now trying to piece together my fucking CV because some assholes from outside decide that despite my massive contribution to the company the last 6 months, I'm dead weight.

&#x200B;

That's a detail I left out, I'm 99% sure this decision is off the back of the two new management that came with the company who bought us ? they completely misunderstand what makes us who we are, and the product will fail, because they're going to end up with this souless piece of shit that will nowhere near resemble what the team is capable of ? they've hired so many management and mid-level managers that are fucking snakes and sharks ? either there to twist the knife or show you it before they strike, it's fucking horrendous and frankly could end up being one of the best things that happens to me, being let go.

&#x200B;

And what's frustrating is, it's not like I'm totally fucked ? I've had a LOT of offers, as I've been in this industry for over a decade, and I'm REALLY good at what I do, it's just that the wound is fresh and I fucking hate that I have to say goodbye to the second best thing that happened to me, behind meeting my wife.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I don't even swear this much normally, it's just that this seems like the most appropriate time for it.

&#x200B;

So as I say, I'm home alone right now, updating my CV to send to the dozens of places who've contacted me, but frankly all I want to do is cry ? I thought I was okay, as I've had a day and a half since it happened, but today my wife is back at work, so it's the true test of being alone, and I'm close to fucking destroying everything in sight. I hate this, I want to tell everyone this but I can't, for fear of completely destroying my career ? even writing this post there's a slight chance it might catch the eye of the wrong person who puts two and two together, but I don't care, I need to fucking say something to someone, even if it's anonymously to strangers, who frankly might not even read it just based on the sheer length and rambly nature of this.

429,429,"My great aunt (my grans sister) has been a widow for the past 3 years. For a year before her husband died, he was very ill and we as a family stepped up to help them, taking them to appointments, taking them out shopping and to places like the garden centre if they wanted. They did not have any children of their own and so it fell to us. After he died we knew that she would depend on us more and we were prepared for that. We continued on visiting her everyday as she had medication that she said she couldn?t administer herself (we knew this was a lie but thought she would eventually stop) and this continued on for two years. We never received any thanks for helping her or any acknowledgment that we were going out of our way to help, which made some of us resentful as she expected us to take time off work regularly to help her. She has never had a job and so doesn?t understand what it?s like when you have to work to afford food/a house etc.

Then my grandad became unwell and ended up in hospital for a few weeks. During this time my gran didn?t go to visit my great aunt as she was too tired after visiting my grandad in the hospital. However my mother and myself still visited her a couple of times a week and made sure she attended any appointments she had and that she went shopping. We even arranged for a carer to go and administer her medication however she then miraculously became able to do it herself again ?. My great aunt did not like that she was not getting as much attention and so began to be very abusive towards my gran over the phone, telling her that my grandad was going to die and that we deserved it because we are ?horrible people?. She also began to hurl abuse at each of us when we visited her to take her out and she would constantly complain about us behind each other?s backs. Her favourite line was ?you?re not a real family?. 
My grandad thankfully made a full recovery and was able to come home, however, we were reluctant to go back to visiting my great aunt everyday after what she had said about us all. 

Now, years later, she continues to ring my gran everyday, saying things to upset her on purpose and regularly making her cry. She tells her that everyone she talks to thinks she?s an awful person, that their mother would be ashamed of her and things like this. No matter how much we tell my gran to ignore what she says and to hang up the phone my gran won?t because she feels guilty. It?s making my gran ill and her health is not great anyway. We are worried that the constant verbal abuse might have some serious consequences for our gran but cannot find a way to make my great aunt stop.

TL;DR Been living a lie for a year. Thought HS was easy. Didn't take college seriously my last two years. Fucked up my degree. Went to coding bootcamp. Just got an offer for a job in tech and I need to let everything out.  


Dunno how long this will be. Today I finally received an offer for a tech job. I feel like crying because I've been living a lie to everyone. Close friends, family, strangers, acquaintances, literally everyone. Everyone thinks I graduated with a degree in CS last year and that I've been working since the fall. What actually happened was for my junior and senior I bombed every course. Did not put in effort when things got hard. My laziness and failure kept feeding into my insecurity that even if I did try I would fail anyways so what's the point.

&#x200B;

After ""graduation"", I was desperate to get a job. I signed up a coding bootcamp that didn't make you pay upfront because I figured I had enough coding/computer science knowledge to do well. I just didn't know how to actually \*\*\*MAKE\*\*\* something. I did not have any friends after graduation because I did not have enough money to go out to eat or drink all the time like my other friends with full-time jobs. I had some money saved from part time work during college, so I used that to make it seem like I wasn't deadbeat. During the summer, I told everyone that I would be starting my job in the fall. I was actually going to be enrolled in a coding bootcamp until February. This was my ""training"" for my new job. 

&#x200B;

I know some people look down on coding bootcamp, but it was a great experience. Here I didn't have to lie to anyone about who I was or what I'm doing. It taught me to be confident in my work again and not to be afraid to fail when I'm creating. But when bootcamp was over, I had to face reality again. I still had no job. Bootcamp took 60+ hours of my week and now I had more time to myself than I knew what to do with. I started applying like mad. I applied to every entry level position I could find. During this time I still lied about where I was working. Claiming that I was ""working remotely"" when I really was just applying to find a job. I thought maybe once I got one, I could return to normal and everything would be ok.

&#x200B;

There were a lot of bad days. Days where I would just give up and stay at home in bed. Told my parents how flexible my job is so I could do this. Now I finally have an offer for a job. To everyone, the reason to celebrate is because I have a new job! But for me it's because it's my \*\*\*FIRST\*\*\* job. Over the course of this year, I've kept a decent amount of college friends and made some new friends who I would say I'm very close to. I don't know if I should just leave all of this in the past. Come out to my friends or what. I know I lied about who I am and I am afraid of the consequences. The lie to me seems major since I lied about a whole year of my life.

People who commit suicide, we as society call them weak.  They are not weak,  they are tired. Tired of feeling this way,  tired of not feeling well, tired of feeling like they have been run over, tired off feeling like world hates them. They have been run over by their brain.

I love that people share the suicide hotline. Althought many people on that path will not call. Their emotions are hard to talk about, mainly because they have no solid reason to feel this way. Share that hotline but do this. If you know someone might be depressed, or their behavior has changed; isolating them self, telling you they are too busy or dont feel like it. Tell these people (and all the ones you love), that they are wanted they are loved, they have a purpose in life. They are not supid, the world does not hate them, and that you love them and care for them not matter what. Hopefully when more people reach out and we can stop suicide in its tracks.

469,469,"So I(M-20) had two women from my sophomore year of highschool until about 5  months ago. For clarity, I graduated in 2017.  So let me set the tone here. Both girls names start with ?A?, and the both are complete opposites. So girl number 1 was my first love, and we dated in middle school for two years. Got into high school and broke up. Sophomore year started, I got with girl number 2. She was great, proclaimed she was a ?virgin? and my teenage mind thought jackpot lock it in. So I got to know her in every way I could so I could fit her mold of the man she wanted. Then girl number 1 came back, and I fiddled around with her too. Why not? Well I end up breaking up with girl number 2, and fuck her best friend to get her to leave me alone because she?s gotten to attached. Junior year starts, I start dating girl number 1 again exclusively. But this entire time girl number 2 stayed around. And supposedly had this birth control device that?s up inside her cervix/uterus(I?m not sure sorry). Well about 2 weeks before I started dating girl number 1 again, we found out girl number 2 is pregnant. I panicked, I ignored it and I blocked out girl number 2. Well eventually girl number 1 found out and I acted like I had no idea and she felt even worse that I found out through her. Girl number 2 is about 6 months pregnant, and I start going back and forth between both girls exclusively. It made me look like shit, it was bad. It was like a reality tv show. But I honestly just found both of them attractive and wanted both of them but they hate each other(obviously). So then girl number 1 is pregnant. Girl number two has my son in February. Out of impulse of winning a big jackpot at a casino, I buy and engagement ring for girl number 2. Then I say never mind but she keeps the ring because she says it?s the nicest thing I?ve given her( I still continue to go back and forth after this). Girl number 1 has my son in August on the day I start college. Girl number 1?s family hates me and filed restraining orders and also kicks me out of hospital room when I showed up for birth. I can?t blame them. But whatever, I hire a lawyer, beat the restraining orders, and force her family to let me see him. It makes a good love story me and girl number 1 reunited. I continue going back and forth, then I find out girl number 2 sucked a guys dick at a party, I get angry and go out and fuck her best friend( different one) for a week straight, snort xanax(this was a new one for me) and get high and drunk. I totally forgot I had finals in the morning, go and pass all my finals but fail a class for my attendance. Get put on academic probation, my family is disappointed ( I got a 27 on my act and went to a community college so I thought I was capable and was gonna breeze through but this ruined my confidence) so I quit/didn?t re-enroll. Then I get back with girl number 1 and keep fiddling with girl number 2 again. Girl number 1 is completely dependent on me, living arrangement and food and transportation. Girl number 2 has her own place now, job, car and is about to get an associates degree. I work a dead end job at a casino as surveillance. Girl number 2 moved on and found a boyfriend and has shut me out and filed child support. I live with my best friend, and girl number 1 lives with my parents now. I can?t stand her, but I don?t wanna leave because I need someone constantly (in a sexual manner). I constantly have this feeling of regret and yearn girl number 2. But she claims she hates me completely now and has went on about finding a man that has a bigger dick, pleases her and so on. Nearly 5 years with girl number 2, and much more with girl number 1. Both have my children, and I feel like I must choose one or the other, I?m so scared. I make like 10 bucks an hour. Child support from both would leave me with nothing.

I being reading about the subject and started to think in my childhood, it was good, but never had true validation from my brothers and parents, and I always felt dismissed, also some time ago I started to remember someone touching me when I was maybe between 11 and 14 years old. I remember this being in bed sleeping and suddenly waking up with an erection and someone rubbing me with his hand, I remember just turning around and back to sleep. It was something I tried to ignore when it happened, but now I can't. Also I remember having a strange sexual behavior as a child, I don't remember when things happened but I am guessing around when I was 6, I knew about sex and one time when I was sleeping over a friends house we started to talk about it, at some point I asked if he wanted to try it and he said yes, at some point I had pain in my penis and stopped, he wanted to continue but we went to sleep, we were good friends a few more years after that and never try it again. 

Also I remember when I was about 6-7 maybe 8 years old, when I was in elementary school, I had this classmate, I don't remember being really friends or much about him just that we were classmates, but after classes we hid in the yard on some bushes and masturbate each other.

Recently my mother had to move her mother into her home. Before then I?ve had very little contact with my grandma as I came into adulthood just phone calls every now and then. Now that she lives with my mother I visit her every afternoon after work so she doesn?t have to be alone while my mother takes an hour long drive home. ( my step father works 2ed shift so he?s here all day with her ) we mostly sit on the porch and chat. Here?s why I believe she has a mental illness and it?s not just her getting old.  
From what I?ve been told since I was a child mental illness runs in our family. My maternal uncle is a paranoid schizophrenic and my maternal great aunt was as well she killed her self because of it.  I don?t have much of any knowledge of mental health and illness but there has been some red flags I can remember from childhood and now as an adult. 
When I was a little girl my grandmother baby sat me and my sisters after school I was very young around 6-7 but I remember she would punish us in strange ways for example if we poked our tongues out at each other she would tell us she?s going to cut them right out I remember that scared me but it was supposed to however one day I don?t think I will ever ever forget is when my eldest sister stuck her tongue out at me and I told on her my grandmother grabbed a pair of real scissors and held them to her mouth in my memory it?s really graphic and horrible her yelling at my sister and tell her to stick her tongue out pushing her cheeks together my sister crying and wiggling but  she didn?t ever cut her I think she just let her go but that has stuck with me as well as many other little threats and cruel words. Now as an adult while I sit with her for an hour or 2 a day she says some really troubling things to me when it?s just her and I. Around other family members she?s all smiles and sweet. I find myself thinking am I crazy or did she really just tell me her biggest mistake in life was having children and she wishes she would have rid herself of them at a young age... and how if at all do I tell my mom what she says. She often gives me advice on training my children to be submissive and seen and not heard( I have no kids and I tell her this every time. ) I?ve confided in my SO about what she tells me and his advice is to not let her speak to me the way she does and put my foot down.

Exchange has been the worst experience of my life and I wouldn?t recommend doing it if you are in a relationship and plan on doing it long distance.

I don?t even know where to begin. We?ve been together for 7 months and we broke a month ago and I haven?t been able to think straight ever since. I thought that posting something on this sub would help me out in someway.

Everything before leaving for exchange (10,000km away from home) was perfect. We never had a fight, never had a single dispute, never even disagreed on anything. She was the perfect girlfriend and the thought of breaking up never even crossed my mind.

Things went to shit the moment I stepped into my exchange university. The first week was pretty overwhelming and quite disorienting, socializing and making new friends never was an easy task for me so it required my full attention. It is during this week where I think I messed up and triggered a series of unfortunate events.

The very first week I messed up 3 times:

\>One night I came back into my dorm, facetimed her and she directly told me that I had to go see her during spring break, stupid me told her that it was way too soon to make plans and that everything was a blur for me and perhaps the friends (that I hadn?t made at the time) would want to go on a trip somewhere. This really pissed her off and for the right reasons.

\>She also told me to put a picture of us as my phone wallpaper, I said yes but in reality felt awkward about doing so especially since I would meet a lot of new people I didn?t necessarily want them to look at a cute picture of us when they would look at my phone for the first time. Anyways, one day she asked me to show my phone and obviously the picture of us wasn?t there, she had a full mental breakdown and thought I was gonna cheat on her, etc? Again, I understand that I messed up on my part really thought this was out of proportion.

\>Last but not least, we both new that we would not see each other as well this summer because we had internships in different countries. We were really sad about it and I said that we would have to ?suck it up and deal with it?. That again blew out of proportion, in my opinion, and triggered her. But looking back, I realized that I should?ve not been that dry about it.

After the first week, things kinda went back to normal. We had normal conversations and thought that we would not have any more dispute. Boy was I wrong. After the first week, I had already made a solid friend group. In that friend group was this girl with a very ?mean? instagram account. My ex-gf noticed that this girl followed me on my meme-instagram (important for context) and immediately started to ask me question. I had to give a detail description of every single girl friend in my friend group, if they were single, who were their boyfriends, etc? That really stressed me out. I felt really restrained.

One night we decided to go to the beach with this friend group (3 guys 2 girls) until 1:30 am. I told my ex-gf that I would call her at 1:00 am when I come back, however we only came back at 1:30am. My ex-gf freaked the crap out because I was 30 minutes late and freaked out even more when she learned that I was there with them and accused me of going on a ?double-date?. I had to talk to her until 4 am to make her understand that these people were just friends and I only cared about her. She basically was saying that I wasn?t her first priority and that I should be giving more attention which I really believed wasn?t true at the time.

This kind of event occurred frequently. She started being agressive in the way she was texting and talking to me. She would regularly ?fake break-up? with me or say stuff like ?if you can?t handle me just leave me?. That really made me freaking sad as most of this stuff was completely out of my control. Sure I chose the wrong friend group but I really don?t think I deserved all this negativity from her.

I occasionally post memes on my meme instagram account. Every time I would post a meme, that ?mean? girl would comment on it. This was totally out of my control and I refused to tell her to stop commenting as I didn?t want her to get involve with my relationship. My ex-gf would obviously go full on mental breakdown every time this was happening. I now realize that I should have not been posting memes as this was just making things worst for us. I even had the misfortune to be in one of the story of that ?mean girl? and she cried for hours.

I was so scared of pissing her off again that I refused to go in all the trips my friend had planned because that ?mean? girl was always there.

I ended up buying a plane ticket to go see her during spring break, unfortunately she had to leave to her country of origin because of a family emergency. At this point we both knew that the relationship was over. Seeing her for spring break was the last resort to fix things between us. She started being super cold with me and we did not talk as often as we used to. She had class 8 hours a day every single day, we had 6 hours time difference so we basically never were able to talk that much.

One day she tells me that she wants to go on a study ?break?. That means that we would not be together / talk for 2 weeks. Because I really wanted her to do well on her exams I accepted it. Of course stupid me kept on talking to her. At the end of the break, she tells me that this guy asked her out on a date and she said yes and that he kissed her at the end of it. She came back to me crying and told me that she regretted everything. I obviously was pissed at her but was blinded by love (I still am) and so I decided to get back with her. 2 days later I decide to post a meme (I?m not smart) and obviously the ?mean? girl commented on it. My ex-gf had another mental breakdown. Why was I not allowed to be mad at her for going on date with some random guy while on a ?study? break but she was allowed to be mad at me for something I essentially had no control over? That really made me so angry. I told her that her going on a date with some random person just to make me jealous was a form of emotional abusive, she got super defensive and furious. She started showing me definitions of emotional abusive and how I was wrong.

I reached out to some of my friends, told them the story and they advised me to break up with her. I did it the next day and immediately regretted it. Note that at the time she had already ?broken up? with me like 5 times.

In retrospect, she was studying for exams and perhaps was over reacting due to stress. She ended up failing one exam and blamed me for it.

Long story short, my friends prohibited me from talking to her, but after two weeks I couldn?t help it and started texting her again. At that point I was really desperate and tried to ?crawl back? as best as I could. I even admit to have been manipulative in what I was saying to her in hopes that it would trigger something positive in her. She ended up telling me that I was treating her like shit, which I believe wasn?t true. That I wasn?t always there for her and that I was making her cry all the time. She said that we were too different, I?m a finance major she is a med student. I only have 2 more years in the city we?re both living in, she has 4 more years.

She told me she started dating someone three weeks ago and said that I should forget about her. This freaking broke my heart and I haven?t been able to sleep, eat well ever since. I lost 14 pounds within a month.

Spring break time comes along, I went to visit my family. She is visiting her family. We ended up being in the same city (Dubai) for 12 hours. I told her to come see me at the airport, she refused. The next day she texts me crying and says how sorry she is and that she?s a bad person,etc? I kinda regained hope and started texting her even more. This only lasted for a day, she became a cold shortly after. But I was still blinded by her initial reaction and took her mood change really personally, I essentially became even more desperate and had many many mental breakdown. I just had one today. Now she thinks that I am crazy, I?m really not. Breaking up made me realize that I perhaps had taken this relationship for granted. I told her that I was willing whatever it takes to make it work between us, that I was willing to change for the better but she refused.

What do you think I did wrong?

Maybe I should add that her past boyfriends have cheated on her so she is VERY paranoid (which I didn't know before going on exchange). Is this perhaps the root cause of all those problems?

I genuinely want to know. I really wanted to fix our relationship but she didn?t seem to be that interested in doing so. I am so heartbroken, she was my first girlfriend and losing her makes me feel like shit. I don?t know what to do anymore. She told me that I could have dinner with her in June when I come back, but now she changed her mind and never wants to see me again. I?m so sad, I?ve never felt this bad before. I cry every night just thinking on what I?ve missed out. I am going insane and would therefore appreciate any insight you guys might have.

I really want to get back with her but now I think I ruined my chances after basically begging her to get back with me for the past 2 weeks.

I told her that I would not give up on our relationship, that I would reach out again in June and if it doesn?t work that I would reach out again in September.

486,486,"My mother was married to her 2nd husband (also a divorcee) a little over 15 years ago, for 2 years. They were together for 6 years altogether. 


She always claimed they had 1, lone argument in the 4 years prior to getting married; something about directions when they were abroad. 2 weeks before they got married and a week before we all moved in together, he did a personality-180 and never went back. It began with emotional abuse and, suffice it to say, despite the red flags, my mother still married him. 


As a result of their disastrous marriage, including his physical abuse of my mother, my siblings and I all found our ways out and now all live on different continents. One even joined a cult, which speaks for itself. 


When they first got married, I still lived at home. After about 3 months I had to get out. One time after some physical abuse, she called the police (side note: he went berserk bc he was tangentially connected to the judicial system and was scared it would affect his position(!)), and I remember her coming to my place and sitting on the couch with me, my roommate and RM?s friends, helpless, because she?d had to escape to her kid?s house cos her husband had hit her. 

Another time, he slammed a door into her and when she went to the doctor a few days later, she refused to reveal exactly what had happened and just said she?d fallen off a ladder. I remember even calling the doctor to try and get them to put what really happened in her notes and they refused, citing that they had to hear it from her. 


The marriage lasted 2 years and when they got divorced he moved abroad. Suddenly, when they divorced, everyone and their dog remembered how he was ?difficult? and ?had a temper? etc. during his first marriage. WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU ASSHOLES BEEN HIDING??!!


I don?t think my mother ever really told many people what actually happened and although it was obvious something had gone awry, she never publicly pinned it on him, presumably bc then she?d have to admit she fucked up by marrying him, despite the warning signs. 


Anyway, cut to 2019, he died last week. Mother found out bc a relative found out through Twitter. She told him not to tell me and siblings, and he didn?t, even though he and I are close. So she ?waited? 2 days and then told us, allegedly bc she?d wanted to see it in b&w(!). 


Suffice it to say, I?m delighted that he?s dead. Couldn?t give a shit. Where does my mother get off not telling me for 2 days? Not like she found out through a ?private? source; fucking Twitter. Her reasoning is that it wouldn?t make a difference... so why not tell me?

488,488,"I?ve never told anyone any of this and I kind of want to get it off my mind, I?ve repressed almost all of my feelings for all of my life. I?ve always isolated myself so here?s me opening up I guess?

I was born, I spent the first three years of my childhood with only my mom. During this time she had a boyfriend,(Fuck you andy) who for some reason got joy out of torturing me. He even would try to drown me in the bathtub. My mom would go to work as she was basically a single mom with no family around really. So he would often offer to babysit me for her. The one I remember most vividly started with her leaving, like usual, but that day I missed her more than anything, I couldn?t stop myself from crying for her to come home. She was my protection. I guess he didn?t like that I was crying. Or maybe I was crying because I knew it was going to start again. He chased me around her apartment with a belt, occasionally hitting me. Until I ran into her room and kept screaming. He threw me onto her bed and slammed the door and locked it. I spent hours locked in that room. All by myself. He even left, I remember the red truck the piece of shit was driving. He only came back before my mom got home to unlock the door but for some reason I never told her about it. I guess I was scared of what would happen to me. This was the start of repressing everything. 

Fast forward. I?m four or five now. Mom finds out he?s an abusive pos but not to me, only because he was abusive to her. She gets in contact with my real dad and asks him if he would want to get back together, and be in my life not just for me but for her, because she loved him. For a while things were okay. It was cool having a dad. He would take me camping, we went golfing, played games he would even let me go to work with him and put down flooring. I developed a love for my father, just a typical father son relationship. Until it started again. I would do something to get in trouble and I would get my ass whooped with a belt, sometimes by hand. But only now do I realize maybe hitting me twenty plus times did more bad than good. During this time I still had family, before it all fell apart my cousins would come and stay. They were older than me. One who I still love dearly to this day was probably around 15 and the other one, who I hate was two years younger than him. Me being young and unknowing I guess he knew he could take advantage of that. I was raped, numerous times over the course of the weekend that he stayed. I don?t wanna go too much in detail but I didn?t really know too much as to what was happening to me. I was pretty sheltered when it came to anything sexual. I hadn?t really a clue that I was being raped or defiled in anyway. It doesn?t really bother me today, it hasn?t affected my sex life in anyway; I only wish I could torture him for what he did to me. He no longer looks at me when he sees me, which fortunately is almost never because that family lives two hours away. I only told my mom about it a couple of years ago and she?s been really good about making sure if we make plans with them that he won?t be there. But for years I had to see him and be around him at family outings and whatnot. After everything he did to me they never came to stay again. So that was over and done, but the trauma wasn?t.

I?m about 10 now. My family moved to a smaller town, with a smaller school up in a mountainous area. This was when everything really bad started to go down. We found out my father was sick, and even though he wasn?t perfect I still loved him. I spent as much time with him as I could. He was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. He was a fairly big man at around 235lbs at diagnosis. For a while they couldn?t figure out what was wrong with him. But for some reason he always insisted he was in pain. The symptoms worsen and he?s getting smaller. Was prescribed numerous pain pills, for a while it was methadone then morphine, he also had Valium and loritabs. My mom was on anxiety medication (Ativan). He would quite frequently steal them and manage to eat 45 in two days. He would always run out of morphing before his next prescription so he would start withdrawing and be absolutely vile to all of us. He tried to throw my mom off of a porch one day. Screaming at her and screaming at us. I mostly secluded myself to room and very rarely came out. But when he?d get his meds filled again the first few days he would stay so fucked up off of them that he literally thought a flip flop was a burger and was EATING crayons dipped in marinara sauce. Which honestly I find hilarious now but at the time I didn?t understand. But after he would realize he was gonna run out he would slow down on them and we?d have our ?normal? dad for a few days.. things only got worse though. It was up and down all of the time. He overdosed numerous times and getting off the bus with you 5 year old sister to find your dad foaming at the mouth really does something to your mind. He went into a psych ward for a while because they thought it was intentional. He got out and nothing changed. He was still abusing his morphine and would frequently force me and my sister to get in the car with him because he wouldn?t leave us home alone while my mom was working. I can not describe how scary it is to have someone who?s nodding off and swerving all over the roads driving you around. 

It wasn?t really until the age of 12 that I understood he was an addict with a sickness, And not my dad with a sickness. He crashed and totaled numerous cars leaving my mom with lots of debt. He ruined her credit and stole money to buy drugs with. Then we had some neighbors move in in front of us. These people were horrendous. Really big into heroine and even had two kids. They would fall asleep with cigarettes and burn their kids, dirty needles everywhere. But for some reason my dad befriended them. Everything got worse when he met some men named Archie and chuck Who he must?ve convinced himself was his friends. They weren?t. They stole his pills and would disappear for a while. Then they?d come back the next time he got them filled. They would get him so doped up he?d pass out and then steal again. So what did my dad do? He kept letting it happen. And when he had no money and no pills he would start pawning stuff. Selling it whatever he could do to get money. All of my moms jewelry. All of my games and consoles. But we weren?t rich by any means and lived paycheck to paycheck. It was just the things we had collected over the years. There?s too many times to even recall them all but all of us would be drug along with him by him to the middle of nowhere for various drug deals. My mom wanted so bad to leave him and to get us out of there. But I insisted we stay, and so did my sister because he was helpless. That was a mistake. He didn?t change and had no interest in changing. Even after we all told him we?re gonna leave if he doesn?t do something or at the least TRY. it meant nothing to him. The overdoses continued, so did the abuse and the withdrawals. He pushed all of our family away from us and we still have none of them to this day because of all the meds he stole and the stuff too. One thing I should mention is he promised all of us that he never shot up. That he would never ever shoot up. 

Finally we?ve had enough, I turn 14 and in November we give up on him. We move out and into a trailer that?s quite literally falling apart, the floors the ceilings everything like two miles away. It wasn?t much but I?ll forever be grateful for it because we didn?t have to pay rent because our ?adopted? grandpa let us stay there. My mom was bettering herself by going through nursing school and working a full time job just to provide for us. I started homeschooling because public school was way too much for me, the people, the anxiety the depression. Every time I got checked out I thought it was because my dad died, it never was, I couldn?t be that fortunate. My dad, who was still spending all of his money on drugs didn?t really seem to care. It?s like we gave him what he wanted. But only when he would sober up (which for him was taking his meds the way he was supposed) would he actually care that we didn?t want to see him. 

He had put himself in one nursing home but was kicked out because he was snorting his morphine in the bathroom or was attempting to shoot it I can?t remember. 

He moved to an extended stay motel in probably like may of 2016, this was the beginning of the end. We would stay with him once a month for two days, but he couldn?t even be normal for us two days a month. Everything would be fine during the day, then he?d go into the bathroom at nighttime for a long time and then literally crawl out and sleep on the floor. It was so terrible because sometimes he would literally shit himself in a tiny single room with only a bathroom. The whole night I would stay up to make sure he wasn?t dead with the smell of shit in the air hoping my sister wouldn?t wake up. Eventually we stopped going. And he put himself in a another nursing home around August right after his birthday. Only because I was house sitting for my grandparents, I was still only 14 but I was watching their house for a week. He was supposed to be with me. He didn?t even make it one night and had left me to go do drugs in his motel room. I didn?t say anything until after the week was up because I liked the alone time. At this point he was making an effort. He was actually trying to get better, or at least I tell myself that so I hate him less. We visited more often when he was there because we couldn?t be forced into staying for all of the bad. Then one day, August 31st we get a call saying he?s unconscious and that he was being taken to the hospital. One of the nurses had administered his insulin, which bottomed out his sugar and put him into a diabetic coma. He laid in the bed for a while before anyone noticed he wasn?t waking up. At this point he had been in and out of the hospital so many times this wasn?t new to any of us and I was quite sure he was gonna live through it. He didn?t. I spent six days in the hospital until he died on September 6th, 2016 at 3:05pm. Three days before my birthday. I watched him die. I felt so relieved. Is that bad? That I was happy he died. I still kind of am because my life has only gotten better, at least compared to what it was. I still remember the way the funeral home shook when I played the songs he wanted played, remember everything by 5FDP. 

I moved on after that. I repressed a lot of things. But one day we?re driving me, my mom and my sister. I found his old phone in the car door. With videos in them. They?re four hours long. He was documenting himself and his method of making his morphine something to shoot up. And I quote ?You?re right (mothers name) we all fucking shoot around here.? 

This pretty much killed us. Cause we had no solid evidence that he did so we never believed it until then. 

But now life is only seeming to get worse. I have a copious amount of mental issues and my mom might have cancer. And I swear if she does, and she dies..  I?ll probably kill myself honestly. If you made it this far thanks for listening... it?s kind of all over the place but there was way too much that?s happened to me.. way too much repressed and it?s kind of hard keeping everything in chronological order.. have a wonderful night people of reddit.

Kind of unrelated, but I also dress very plainly. I'm a 15-year-old girl and you know how they dress these days. I wear the same clothes every day in a school that has no dress code. I don't have the money or confidence to wear other clothing aside from what I already wear.

*Some backstory:*  
*I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ADHD, panic attacks, Borderline, severe OCD, suicide thought and from time to time I'm suicidal. On top of all this, I'm in the middle of finding out whether I have Asperger or not. I've had addictions but I'm kind of sober. The thoughts is still there, but the actions aren't.*  
*My fiance is by my side through everything, lifts me up, make me laugh through my tears, do check ups on me each hour when he's at work if I'm having a bad period, just to know I'm still alive. He has three times during our four year relationship literally saved my life (once, he dragged me inside when I was about to jump out of the window from 3rd floor). He's amazing in every way, and I'll probably never understand how he just gets through this all, with out questioning me or my acts/feelings/behavior.*

I hit rock bottom. Again. I've lost count on how many times it has happened through my 27 year short life. I'm hurting myself, both emotionally and physically. I've been struggling to get back up on my feet for a few months, and last week I got accepted to try to work. I'll be there for two days a week, just 3-4 hours each time, and it's completely up to me to chose when I want to be there and/or not. My boss knows my difficulties and will adjust the tasks to fit me.  
However, I've had a bad period for three weeks now. I've hid it from my fiance all this time, because I don't want to bother him with my problems. Though I know he's never judged me, I'm still afraid every single day, that he will. It's impossible for me to understand that he loves me, like genuinely loves all of me, during these crash downs. Yesterday, I woke up crying. Shaking from anxiety, headache, nausea, and I was ready to just give it all up. To run out of the house and just lay down on the train tracks and end my life. For good. After a few hours in bed, I managed to crawl out if and sit my pathetic ass down in the chair in front of the computer and just look at the screen. Just stare at it, but somehow not see anything. I had my boxes of medication beside me, and the urge of overdosing was overwhelming. In the same time, the urge of cutting myself and just get rid of the most acute anxiety was there as well. Though I was a complete emotionally meltdown, I was enough ""awake"" to be able to choose between the two of them. I chose self harm. At the very moment, I'm relieved, but a few hours later, the anxiety hits again, twice the power than before, and then the shame comes creeping up through my spine like ice and fire in the same time. I'm ashamed for hurting myself. I'm ashamed that I hurt others by hurting myself. It hurts more than words can describe when I see the disappointment in mt fiance's eyes when he sees the wounds. He's not disappointed at the direct injuries, but by the fact that he wasn't there to stop me. That I chose to hurt myself instead of turning to him. I'm normally shutting down and refuse to talk to people about my problem there and then, because I don't want to be a liability to others. I don't want to drown others in my problems more than I already do, just by existing.  


I'm a little bit better today, but I'm still in to deep shit at the moment and I don't really know where to go but here.

I was watching live pd on youtube and saw a middle aged woman get pulled over on a traffic stop. Her face was blurred but everything about the way she dressed, her stature and nervousness in the situation made me think of my mother. The cop started asking hard questions and she was clearly on edge and made the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard ""I can't talk to you anymore I have to go to the bathroom"" as a last ditch effort. I just thought my mother would probably do something like that, if it was her she wouldn't know what to do either. My mother isn't a criminal. It was evident to me that this woman wasn't a real criminal either. She was being used, and imaging if my mum was hard on her luck and ended up in that situation made me want to cry. Everything about it made me want to physically vomit. The cops seemed sad about it all too.

On the flip side I saw another guy around my age get busted with like a kilo of heroin he was moving. When the cop asked him if he had any he said he'd swallowed half a gram which could easily kill someone. Listening to the guy speak he had no attitude just sounded resigned and slightly scared. Imagining myself in his shoes I thought ""yeah if I was that guy and realised I was gonna go to prison for a long time, my options are narc on my boss or go longer, not withstanding telling my family what happened - or knowing I cost my boss a lot of money and they know I have a family... I'd probably kill myself too.""

I'm a single mom of a 8 years old sweet, yet difficult, boy. I love him deeply, he's my life, we have one another and are really close. 

I became pregnant by accident but didn't mind it because I always wanted to be a mom. My little one was born with a host of health problems, and also diagnosed within the autism spectrum at the age of 4. Things were difficult but good until about three years ago, when he started acting very defiantly, having meltdowns related to the ASD and issues with his dad. He was kicked out of two different schools. We started therapy and medication, for him and for me. But still, I transformed into this witch, a crazy person who can't take the meltdowns and normal little boy tantrums. I have no patience for him, it's al gone. I have mistreated him, slapped him a couple of times, spanked him a couple of times too. And I yell, a lot. This doesn't happen all the time, most of the time we are cuddling, playing, and having a good quality time. But when he starts with annoying things I just lose my temper and explode. I literally see red. 

Today we had a screaming match because he wanted to go see shazam (we already went, he wanted to leave the theater 10 minutes into the movie, so we did). I said ""no, we already went to see this movie and you decided to leave. We can watch another movie and wait for shazam to be available on dvd, netflix, whatever"". He then hit me, kicked me, cried for an hour combined with screaming ""I want to go se shazaaaam"". And I lost it, again. I didn't hit him (I'm working really hard to control the impulse to do that) but yelled very loudly, like I didn't care anymore. But I do care. Finally we both managed to calm down. I consoled him. He left for school shortly after.

I honestly don't know what to do. I grew in an abusive household, I don't want to be like my father, I don't want that life for my boy but I'm at the end of my rope. I live in a third world country so mental health is not covered through insurance or anything, also it would be impossible for me to go to therapy weekly as I once did because of my jobs (I work three jobs just to pay for his special school, therapies and medication among all the other normal expenses). I try to have some alone time every now and then and that helps. I have even thought of killing myself because I feel like a horrible human but I couldn't do that to him, his father already abandoned him, so that's not a real threat. My mom helps me a lot and is awesome but she's the only supportive person in my life and she's going through her own set of problems.

I know all I have written sound like excuses but they are not, is just my reality, I'm trapped in this awful nightmare of loving and abusing a little boy that deserves better. I want to do better. Any tips or advice? I'm want to start meditation, like short exercise that I could do daily at work, any good tutorials?

0,1500,"#Rule 1 and Truscum

Recently, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of discriminatory comments and posts on this subreddit regarding trans people who do not experience dysphoria - also known as ""truscum"" rhetoric. Proponents often call their stance ""transmedicalism,"" i.e. the belief that being trans is a medical condition (and, necessarily as a consequence, those without such a diagnosis are not actually trans).

This is unacceptable. We do not allow this.

It wasn't written into the rules before because it was considered redundant, but discrimination based on the presence or absence of dysphoria *is in fact a form of discrimination,* and patently against Rule 1. You will be banned for this behavior. We condemn truscum rhetoric in strong terms.

Q&A:

*Isn't this discrimination against us? We're allowed to have an opinion!*

No. Rejecting ideas which directly damage members of our community is not a form of discrimination. You can change your ideological stances any time you want. Non-dysphoric trans people cannot change their identities any more than any of us can.

*The definition of bigotry...*

...is [the following:](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot)  
> Definition of bigot  
>   
> A person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices.  
>   
> **Especially** : one who regards or treats the members of a group (such as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance.

Having particular ideas does not make you part of a group. Your ideas can change, quite easily if you allow them to, and opinions do not constitute an intrinsic identity. A trans person without dysphoria cannot change that fact and your unfounded prejudice against those individuals is not something we find acceptable.

*I can't believe this subreddit has gotten so political/IDpol/snowflakey/SJW/etc, I thought this was a meme sub*

Cry some more. Discrimination has always been against the rules, and that doesn't suddenly become a bad thing just because you're the one with the harmful take.

*Mods are gay >:\^(*

Yeah

#Sexually explicit memes/Thirstposting

There has also been a recent surge in NSFW/sex related posts in this sub. Historically, these posts use to be considered okay, and there wasn't a rule against them. There is nothing inherently wrong with being in touch with your sexuality. But the recent posts have brought up an issue: the presence of minors on this subreddit, and the existence of a dedicated 18+ NSFW sub (r/traaNSFW). Aside from bordering on illegal in some countries, the interaction between minors and much older adults in the comments of many of these posts tends to get very creepy very fast. Therefore, we have decided to disallow overly sexually charged content on this subreddit, and that encourage all such content go to r/traaNSFW instead since that community explicitly excludes minors.

Q&A

*Are you trying to sexually repress young people? I'm 17 and have nowhere to post my trans sex memes.*

No. But we are trying to curb some deeply troubling behavior we have seen recently, and prevent vulnerable young people from being taken advantage of by people who would harm them. This is an issue where we must act in favor of safety. We recognize that sometimes young people do sexual things before their 18th birthdays, but we cannot allow minors to interact sexually with adults and vice versa in our community.

**Edit 3/25:** It's been two weeks. A lot of questions have been asked and answered in this thread. And every single top-level comment has pinged my inbox directly. I'm locking the thread for now and directing all further questions to modmail, so that other mods have a chance to reply if I'm asleep or don't have the energy. ***Read all the replies in this thread before sending us modmail to avoid sending questions we've already answered.

1,1501,"It's a slur. It hasn't been reclaimed. You should NOT call trans people, particularly trans women, traps, **unless they say that they identify with it.** Because yes, some people do identify with it. And that's OK!

&#x200B;

But for much of our community, it's a term that perpetuates harmful stereotypes - that trans women are 'tricking' men into sleeping with them (this is also linked with homophobia and toxic masculinity). Indeed, there is a legal defense in most US states known as the 'trans panic defense', allowing those who attack trans women to get a lesser sentence, because they were so surprised that somebody was trans, they murdered them. And whilst these cases may not use the word 'trap' explicitly, it's the exact same thought process behind it - that transfeminine people are men who wish to trick other men into sleeping with them for some reason.

&#x200B;

I think we can all see why many view this word as highly problematic, and do not identify with it. So please stop arguing that it's OK, that it's not transphobic, that 'it's just an anime joke bro stop being so triggered'. Do not dismiss the experiences of people in our community who have been hurt by this, and do not try to argue that it is harmless. Comments arguing this ***will*** be removed. For more clarification, please see rule 1, and rule 6.

[Recommended viewing for more information. The video discusses how the word is used in anime (the community from which it originated), and how trans people aren't 'traps'. (PedanticRomantic's video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxeB2AXIG3E)

[Optional viewing, it's pretty funny but not suitable to everyone's tastes. It goes into detail regarding the culture that uses the slur and its origins. (Contra's video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg)

[Here](https://lgbtbar.org/programs/advocacy/gay-trans-panic-defense/) is an explanation from an LGBT law organization regarding the panic defence, or the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense) page has a a long list of gay and trans panic defences being used.

507,2007,"Hi, I'm new here, but you all seem lovely and I'm having a hard time. I'm a 29yo who's always identified as cis male. This year, though, something clicked, and I've _really_ starting questioning my physical expression, especially around clothing.

The catalyst was literally a tweet I read that said (paraphrasing) ""if you're cis, and you feel constrained by the choices made available to you in terms of what you wear, how you present yourself, you owe it to all the much more vulnerable people out there who are bravely doing their thing in a much more dangerous position than you to get out there and break norms"".

I thought to myself, ""actually, I really fucking do. I hate the 'uniform' I feel I'm allowed to wear as a man, and especially as a man working on tech"". So I got dresses. I got skirts. My wife showed me how to paint my nails. I got otherwise masculine-coded tops and jeans and shoes but in floral patterns or feminine colours.

And then, I shared pictures of myself online wearing those things. On my twitter, to people who I work with, or know irl, etc etc. I got _so much_ support and compliments and just an outpouring of love. It felt right, I feel like I look right wearing those things. I feel like if I put on my old dark jeans and bland hoodie and didn't look after my hair etc, I'd be hiding myself now.

This is all about appearance so far. But it's made me question a ton about my gender too. And this is where I'm just _lost_. I find it pretty problematic that gender questions have come with clothing questions, to start with: part of why I'm wearing what I am is that I don't _want_ clothing choices to be constrained by gender (or anything else really).

But come along they have all the same: does this mean I might be trans? Does it make me something else? Nonbinary? Gender fluid? Does it need to make me anything? A prevailing thing I see is people saying ""does it make you feel uncomfortable to be referred to as 'he'?"" etc. My answer is: not really? But I also wouldn't mind being called anything else: she, they, whatever. It's just not something I have a strong attachment to at all. I don't know if that means there's nothing to question or if it makes me something very specific.

TLDR: Sorry for the volumes, but that's where I am. Super happy wearing whatever the hell I please at home, anxious (but working on being less so) to do a lot of it outside, and wondering what it all means for me.

Edit: seeing selfies here is inspiring and I want to post my own but feel for some reason like I don't belong, because I'm not convinced I'm anything other than a cis guy who likes wearing dresses...

511,2011,"I was lucky enough to be raised by hippies, who didn't force any binary gender roles on me as I grew up. I knew that after puberty I'd have to wear shirts on hot days when outside the community, so I spent every minute I could riding my bike and playing topless as a kid.    
    
Inevitably, puberty came. I wore sports bras and men's clothes. When my parents were asked about their kids, they said they had 4 boys, because I'd told them I was a boy. I was still just allowed to be me.   
   
It was in college, ironically, when surrounded by hippies again, that I had my first gender ID crisis. I realized all the things I'd gone through growing up (wanting to be a man when I grew up, identifying as a boy as a kid) was what trans men experienced. When I moved into an apartment with 5 girls I realized I really didn't understand them. They had a meeting about decoration themes! What? That's a thing? Was I trans?    
   
I decided that probably yes, but I didn't want to make any changes to my body (partly because I know how hard life would be as a 5' tall trans man, and partially for religious reasons), so I just changed my name. I continued to just be me. As I said, my friends were all hippies, so when it came time to swim, we all wore the same thing: nothing. I was comfortable.    
    
I had a (comparatively) brief swing over on the feminine side from about age 25-35. It was the only time period in my life where I felt comfortable wearing a dress (now, like before, it feels like I'm in drag).    
    
But I swung back to masc hard. I also recently moved.   
   
I've been struggling recently, because when it gets hot, I want to take my shirt off. But I either have to go inside and close all my blinds, or wear a sports bra, which gets gross and sweaty when it's hot.    
   
Then there is swimming. I feel uncomfortable if I'm not wearing swim trunks at least boxer-brief length. I was pairing that with a 1-piece, but it was too much fabric, and when I went to dry out in the sun, I my belly couldn't get any sun (which is the best part). Also, I've lost weight, so every piece of swimwear I have is too large.   
    
I'm hoping to find swimwear I feel comfortable in this weekend. I want small swim trunks (not too hard to find), and a top like a sports bra. Bikini tops are all about maximizing cleavage, which is not what I want. I tried swimming in a black sports bra, and it felt good, but it wouldn't stay on while I swam.    
    
Can anyone give me suggestions as to where I can find swimwear I'm comfortable in? I want feel as close to being like I'm just a dude in swim trunks, but without upsetting the others at the pool by having my breasts out.   
   
Are there sports bras that would stay on while swimming, and dry well? Are there women's swim tops that are about coverage, and not cleavage?    
        
Also, is there any kind of binder/bra/etc that could wear on hot days to feel comfortable without breaking any nudity laws?",1,1556306611.0,bhqbx3,1,genderqueer

I switched back to he/him pronouns and I honestly find it pretty euphoric sometimes, however what remained unchanged is that I still want to transition to have a female body although I wouldn't get SRS and I'm still quite feminine despite the pronouns changes and I still preferred feminine clothes over masculine one.

I am also 80% sure that this was fed by living in semi-constant dissociation, but I don't care because unless I suddenly develop a sense of gender I am still graygender whatever the cause is. I basically spent my life assuming gender was just something you took on based on your genitals and was shocked to find out that people have feelings related to their genders.

Then I was kind of angry that I had never been told it was not ""normal"" to literally not give a shit about what your body looks like. Had some surgeries that affected my hormones and fertility cause tumours, and apparently it isn't ""normal"" to just tell the doctors to cut it all out and not care about fertility, appearance, or anything. Preservation and reconstruction are important to some people (which I respect), but not to me. So then I found out that graygender is a thing and I feel kind of happy to know that I'm not just ""not normal"".

I have had my own struggles with gender identity over the last year, namely because I don't relate to gender at all and realizing this has been an experience. Life was easier when I just went along with my assigned gender without ever questioning it. Realizing that I would have gone along with ANY gender is kind of a trip.

So if anyone else out there feels unsure what their gender is, or if their feelings are valid, or if it is OK to be AFAB and femme, or AMAB and masc, and still feel nonbinary: it's all fine.

However, I've always felt uncomfortable with really blatantly feminine styles - I hate wearing dresses and only ever wear makeup when I have to for theatre - because that's just too much for me and makes me feel really alien in my own body. So, I already dress fairly androgynously, just because I'm happier that way, but I'm looking into maybe getting a binder for the days when I just really can't be bothered with femininity and/or feel less comfortable presenting as a woman. The only problem is that I have really long hair - like, down to my thighs kind of deal -  which I absolutely adore but I'm not sure how I could style that in a way that didn't make people immediately see me as female.

They are comfortable enough, they?ve been assigned certain pronouns all their life so it?s just familiar at this point and if really pressed they?d be fine with any pronouns anyway, so it isn?t enough to really get them thinking or wondering more about it and digging deeper into their own gender and identity.

But it feels... not fake, but I?m worried it?s not valid. That I?m misinterpreting my own privileges for possible gender fruity... (i.e. the reason it doesn?t bother me if someone calls me ?she? - I?m always going to be protected by patriarchy as a man who mostly fits the binary expectation). Other times I really do feel disconnected from one gender, especially a binary gender ID. 

There have been times where I?ve seriously wondered if I am trans but I?ve avoided it all my life until now because of all that binary sex/gender essentialist conditioning and it was never even a possibility I knew to consider until now, and now it feels way too late to transition anyway ?

And then other times I?m like, no I?m a man ?Yes I wear all my clothes from the ?men?s? section because it?s familiar and comfortable, but outside a handful of things, I really I don?t have a lot interest in or identity connection to most ?traditional? expressions of manhood or masculinity.

And then I realize... all that is made up and has nothing to do with gender or identity either and I could act like the most stereotypically masculine male man to ever Be A Man ?? and still be non binary or trans or anything!

I recently started seeing this amazing girl who has been very supportive  of the fact that I am in the midst of exploring my genderqueerness.  After becoming intimate she asked me what sorts of things I need in the  bedroom in order to feel affirmed. I am AFAB but have always felt more  aligned with a masculine identity. I experience dysphoria regarding my  chest but not always with my genitals. There are certain things I know  about how I want to be intimate with another person: i.e. touch my chest  at the top so it feels like a flat chest. But I'm still trying to work  out what other things would feel right.

I completely understand that everyone has a different experience, and  different interests sexually, but I've been really curious to learn more  about what other folks do to feel affirmed while having sex.

I didn?t know how to answer the question ? it felt like a quiz. I have never asked someone to tell me why they like busty women, or brunettes, for example. I tried to come up with a specific thing that I liked and it was hard to do so because I like both male-bodied individuals whose style is more feminine and female-bodied individuals whose style is more masculine....so it isn?t a specific characteristics or attribute that I am attracted to. I then tried to explain how maybe it?s that people who are queer or present as androgynous tend to also share a lot of the personal values that I do and so I have come to associate the characteristics together? I also thought maybe it was because I admire the boldness that it takes to wear whatever the fuck you want and not worry about fitting into a specific mold.

I'm afab and genderqueer/nonbinary.  I'm very unhappy right now because no matter what I do I get read as female. Even on days that I try my hardest to seem androgynous (no bright colors, wearing a binder, no jewelry of any kind) I still get read as female, and it makes me feel terrible, especially because I like doing some ""traditionally feminine"" things, like wearing earrings and sometimes even dresses and makeup, but I know I can't do that anymore of I'll be read as female for sure.   I wish I could wear my binder more, but it makes me feel cold and clammy, and like I said, it doesn't even make a difference in how people react to me.  Even in the queer community on campus (I'm a student) I often get read as female, and one of my nonbianary acquaintances has misgendered me multiple times, even though they know my gender and pronouns and I wear a pronoun pin.  It's like I'm not even nonbinary enough for other nonbinary people to recognize me.  I'm often afraid to go to places like the Pride center because I'm worried people will accuse me of faking, and I'm afraid to correct my professors on my pronouns because I tried doing so (politely) in the fall and as a result the normally friendly professor avoided speaking to me for the rest of the fall and the winter term.

I think I'm interested in looking into a small does of testosterone, but I'm so afraid that I won't like the changes it will cause.  I've made a list in my head of the changes I want and those I don't, but I know there's really no way to control what happens if I start taking it.  And while I want to appear more visibly not female, I'm also afraid to do so because of how trans people are treated.  I'm part of a fairly traditional martial arts school, and have been for five years, and I don't want to lose my place there because of medically transitioning.  The martial arts school feels like a second family to me.  I want to talk to a doctor on campus to get solid facts and advice about low dose testosterone, but I'm worried that because I'm so unsure I'll just be wasting their time, and when I tried to find out who to see and when to set up an appointment the doctor I was talking to started asking questions like ""did you know you were nonbinary when you were a small child?"" and when I told them I might have been, if I had known there was an option other than being a girl when I was that age, but didn't know it was, they seemed very judgmental.  I'm trying to look up information online, to learn more before I try to talk to a doctor again, but I keep panicking because I hear some people say that the changes from non binary transition are never permanent, so I feel like I'll never be seen as how I am, and I see other people who are so happy with how they look, and they look amazing, and I know I'll never be like them.",1,1554837605.0,bbc3eh,15,genderqueer

I give it a quick glance and i realize its all about gender conformity--and I'm thinking *yes! finally a book that relates to me!well.....kind of.*Im about 100 pages in, and yes, i should (and will) read the whole thing, but I've found out that the author is gay, and gender nonconforming. **And there's no problem with that.** I'm just a little frustrated because he doesn't really talk about experiences about trans and straight people, like me, and probably other people, and after i realize that, it just gets more frustrating.

I don't usually think about it much but every now and then, maybe every few months or so, I get so frustratingly aware of the fact that I don't have a dick, and that there's currently no surgery/hormone option that would really accomplish what I want. I don't hate my vagina, it just isn't really of use to me. I don't want to bear children, I'm almost never interested in being penetrated, etc. I tried using an STP a while back and I'm just too scared of like, ending up making a mess out of my clothes in a public bathroom, so I just gave up on that. I don't know if I really care either way about standing or sitting to pee anyway.

As long as I can remember I've just been interested in getting off in the closest ways I can comparable to if I had a dick, all the way back to when I first learned what masturbation was. The second person I dated (I dated men before I realized I'm nb lesbian) got me a dildo, and I was so much more interested in pretending it was attached to me than using it for its intended purpose. But, I suggested to him once ""what if I had a dick?"" and the answer was ""no"", it didn't come up again for a long time. For the next few years, I never really took it seriously. I only really get noticeably dysphoric once in a while, and it's only lasted a few days or so, so I never really had a reason to take it seriously. This time I don't want to just ignore it, but I just don't even know what to make of these feelings.

630,2130,"Hey all! I've never posted here before, but I've got a kind of funny (and for me, brutally embarrassing) story about trying to schedule a haircut at a salon. Actually, I'm still reeling from the embarrassment, so I figured I'd post here to 1) entertain y'all and 2) vent.

The area I live in is pretty conservative and isn't very pro-LGBTQ--I don't think anyone here would hate you if you were gay, but they're definitely less understanding of less well-known identities (like being genderqueer). However, there's a college town about 40 minutes from where I live that's pretty progressive, so I looked up a list of LGBTQ-friendly salons in that area and decided to try booking a haircut.

Background info about me: after over a year of gender confusion and questioning, I'm pretty comfortable identifying as non-binary/genderqueer/transmasculine. Because I'm not firmly FTM, though--or at least, I don't think I am--I've got a good deal of impostor syndrome, especially when it comes to telling people how I identify. (I'm sure y'all know how it is. *Genderqueer* is harder to explain to most people than just *trans guy or gal,* and sometimes the idea of having to explain myself makes me doubt my identity a little.)

Anyway, partly thanks to my current hairstyle, no one really sees me as a transmaculine/genderqueer dude. (Obviously, I'm trying to change that with a new haircut.) I should also add that, because of the whole transmasculine thing, I'm aiming to be read as male and not female. In fact, it's gotten to the point where I wonder if maybe I'm just a guy, period--but that's another story, so I won't go into that here. Point being, I'm genderqueer and looking to present as male/masculine.

So, I found this LGBTQ-friendly salon, *and* I found out that they have online booking--which is a double score, because I hate talking to people on the phone. When I was booking an appointment, though, the site asked me to sign up for either a women's haircut or a men's haircut. I knew that effort-wise my hair qualified as a women's haircut, but in terms of style, I wanted to make sure I got a guy's haircut. Also, I know that for trans people, getting haircuts can be a harrowing (hairowing?) experience, and I wanted to avoid any distress caused by someone trying to give me an androgynous women's cut or something.

Of course, I realized I could just suck it up: sign up for the women's cut, and when I get there, insist with all my might that I'm transmasculine, hoping that they haven't already decided my gender before I even walk through the door. But then I thought, hey! Why don't I email them first and ask?

Yeah, great idea.

(No, really, this was actually a great idea. Just...not-so-great execution.)

Again, my area--really, my state in general--is more conservative, so I was wary of saying that I was genderqueer. I didn't know if they'd understand what that meant, or if they'd associate it with something negative and write me off. And honestly, I'm still having trouble asserting my gender identity; rather than speak up and gently correct someone when they misgender me, I tend to just get pissed and say nothing. But for this haircut, this first step toward really presenting properly, I wanted to own my truth.

...own my truth in a way that did not *explicitly* say I was genderqueer, just in case that would hurt my chances of getting a haircut.

So I ended up writing something like, ""I'd like to get a men's haircut, but my legal gender is female, although I don't identify that way, etc., etc., how should I book the appointment?"" I read over the email, reworded it a few times, proofread it, and sent it to my sibling for a second set of eyes. Everything looked good. This was the perfect email! Satisfied, I sent it off, then spent the next six hours anxiously waiting for a response.

Around dinnertime, I got a very friendly email confirming that yes, because my hair would take longer to work with, I should technically sign up for a women's haircut. However, there was a spot where I could leave a note specifying that I identify as--as--

*Oh, no. What have I done?*

Ah, yes, friends. My first time owning my truth, but I...didn't quite own it. See, apparently the phrasing I used--where I said I wasn't female, but didn't specify what I actually *was*\--led them to believe that I was a trans guy. The last part of their email (about how I could attach a note to my appointment) was telling me to leave a note so that the salon knew I identify as male.

Now, maybe this isn't as simultaneously amusing/horrifying to y'all as it was to me, but oh, was my face red when I read that email. I never considered the possibility that they would automatically assume I was FTM--though in hindsight, what *else* would they assume? Like, man, I really walked into that one. 

So then, of course, I was tasked with the incredibly awkward process of emailing the salon again to try to explain that *no, I'm not technically male...well, yes, I'm definitely more male than female. Actually, have you heard of being genderqueer? Because if you have, then this is really awkward, because I could've just mentioned this to begin with. Uh, actually, I just think I'll try the next salon on the list.*

Okay, so I didn't write that, exactly. However, I did feel really embarrassed and stupid writing that clarification email. I mean, maybe they don't even care how I identify. Maybe that was TMI. And they were so nice and understanding that I hated to ""correct"" them, especially with something that makes a lot less sense than just *trans guy.* 

Then again, if I didn't email them back, I was worried there would be some confusion if the ""guy"" who just emailed them then turned around and booked an appointment as *gender: other.* So, I sucked it up and sent them the awkward email.

Of course, part of me is laughing at all of this, because this is exactly the sort of thing I would do. It wouldn't be the first time I've put my foot in my mouth and given someone the wrong idea about me. On the other hand, now my impostor syndrome is through the roof. I keep thinking that maybe I'm faking being under the trans umbrella, or that I'm wrong and confused, or that I don't deserve to assert myself as transmasculine or genderqueer, et cetera, et cetera.

That's all wrong, of course. I know I'm valid. Lurking on this sub (and texting my sibling 100 times in the past three hours) has taught me that much. Still, this was...not the start I wanted for my first men's haircut, lmao.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this story with y'all because I thought it was funny in a slightly horrible way. Of all the things I imagined going wrong when I tried to book a haircut, this didn't even cross my mind. But I mean, hey, at least I'll be getting my men's haircut. 

And let this be an inspirational message to you all that there *are* accommodating salons out there...even if you accidentally request the wrong kind of accommodations.

641,2141,"Hello!

I'm AFAB and have been gender-questioning (closeted) for over a year now. Since last year I've started presenting more masculine, and for a good sixish months it was definitely at the forefront of my mind to the point where my friend told me I was acting strange -- and then I sort of filed it away and decided that I should stop worrying about labeling myself for now and just enjoy being me. 

Lately I've been starting to get more and more annoyed when people call me by a gendered term like ma'am or miss or young lady. Or when people get excited that they never see me in a dress before because I never wear them. I feel like I'm only treated as wanted or valuable when I'm dressed as a 'lady'. 

I've also been a little bit frustrated with how I want to present myself vs. how I actually present -- I don't think I hate my body but I definitely get frustrated that I don't look as androgynous or as masc as I want to (broader shoulders, more muscular, more square jaw, etc).

I guess what's been stopping me from coming out as gender-questioning is that I'm wondering if it's body dysmorphia I'm feeling and not dysphoria. And I'm wondering if I don't like female-gendered terms because that's just not my thing or whether I don't like it because of how society treats women/female/femme-identifying people. I feel like and I want to be more than the gender that people perceive me as, but doesn't everybody want that? 

There's a bit more on my mind but that's all I can think of for now. Any advice for someone who's closeted to explore their gender identity? I'm purchasing a binder soon so hopefully that will help me on my way...",1,1553664807.0,b60jgp,3,genderqueer

These are all common things, but what hasn't been common is finding a therapist I clicked with. I found one, out of perhaps sixty, and I was only able to see her for a year before she moved out of the state. 


I simply haven't found someone who seems to get it, and I feel like it's because I don't know what questions to ask.

649,2149,"As much as I understand the inherent limitations involved in asking random internet people to give me advice about a very personal thing in my life, I feel that going it completely alone will likely limit me far more. I was assigned male at birth and have spent the entirety of my life up until a year ago leaving that state of things completely unquestioned. I can?t say that I was ever much of an overtly masculine child, never really feeling all that strong a personal attachment to the concept of masculinity as a whole. This isn?t to say that i wasn?t socialized to behave in masculine ways and express aversions to feminine things; I just don?t recall ever perceiving masculinity and the expectations that surround it as anything important or fundamental to my identity. Traditionally feminine things like girlish tv programs and woman?s clothing definitely appealed to me just as much as the ?boy stuff? that I had been socialized to accept (I fondly recall partaking in the apparently rather common activity of dressing up in my mother?s clothes whenever I got to be home alone). Dressing in women?s clothes (or, at least, things like towels and sheets that I would fashion into skirts, bras, and dresses) was, now that I look back at it, a pretty big guilty pleasure of mine as a kid (and it still is to a decent extent). I lived with, and at the time ideologically formed a part of, a very devoutly conservative and religious family, which might partially explain why I never felt as though any of this merited any further introspection. Recently I?ve noticed that my perception of self and outward expression (by this I mean things like mannerisms of body and speech) have been drifting more and more from what I?d call ?masculine.? While I?m not bothered by these developments themselves, I am finding it difficult to figure out the extent to which they might stem from something fundamental to my person or from some semi-subconscious desire to experience that which was forbidden to me as a child. I don?t ?want? to be either a man or a woman in identity, but I find that I?m reluctant to publicly (or even privately) take on any given label or identity without coming to something of a satisfying answer regarding the actual significance as well as the genuineness of my own feelings.

The good news is that I go by Lou in my day-to-day life, so I could still find a more gender affirming name.

1.5 years ago, I had a nervous breakdown and deleted all social media.

The weirdest part of the brain injury is the memory lapse I have. From October to May of last year, I have a ton of memory loss.

Initially, I thought perhaps this comes from a place of reluctance towards extreme sexist gender stereotypes.

I was born female and given a very feminine name that has no chance of being slightly altered to male (like going from Victoria to Victor or Nicole to Nicholas). It's also a name that does not have a shortened version, like Sam for Samantha or Liz for Elizabeth. I grew up hating the color pink and refusing to wear dresses, but enjoyed painting my nails and keeping my hair long.

Hitting puberty was a tough time for me. I hated the boobs that grew in, but my period didn't feel wrong. Perhaps I hated the attention I got from my growing chest, or maybe it's because I was the first in my class to start developing and I wasn't confident. I honestly have no idea, even today. Not once have I ever thought ""I don't belong in this body"" or ""I don't like being called 'she,'"" but I do remember wearing 4 training bras at once, hoping that my breasts would stop growing, and being insulted by the word ""girly.""

Here's the tricky part... I only want to present masculinely sometimes. There are days when I'll look at myself in the mirror and embrace my feminine figure. There are other days when I'll wake up and feel unhappy until I have my binder on and have my hair shoved into a beanie. On a daily basis, I wear men's jeans and boxer-briefs regardless of what I wear on top, but I've never once had the desire to have male genitals. I wear makeup and nail polish regardless if I'm presenting more masculine or feminine. I find myself dreaming of a gender neutral name, and being very jealous that my extremely stereotypically feminine sister has one instead of me. I have always dislike my name, and I thought it was because of how common it is. But the gender neutral name I wish I had is also fairly popular.

So a drag performance could be called a genderqueer performance since it's about taking gender and gender presentation out of the cishetero lens and looking at it from a more queer perspective.

I hate having breasts and i?ve been wanting a doubly mastectomy or at the very least a reduction for years. I?ve pretty much always disliked my genitals and would 100% have a phalloplasty. I know i should probably talk to my therapist about this or see a gender therapist but it feels awkward for me to talk about. I know this could also be body dysmorphia, but i might as well ask.

751,2251,"So, when Rebecca Sugar (of Steven Universe fame) came out a nonbinary, she described herself as ?a nonbinary woman? because?just like the gems in her show who are coded female and use she/her pronouns but have no actual gender?being seen as female is ?part of her experience?.

Does anyone else consider themselves in this way? Are you ?a nonbinary woman? or ?man?, or are you just ?nonbinary??

I?ve been fighting myself on my gender identity for a while now. I?m a GNC bi woman and the first time I tried to come out as NB/GQ I wound up freaking myself out and taking it back because I suddenly felt like I was losing myself. I read and wrote about gender politics and feminist theory in college and feel like being female is an inextricable part of myself and my experience. When I came out as NB I felt like I was wiping that away, and it gave me the feeling like I was floating out of my body and I no longer knew myself...when coming out was supposed to make me feel MORE like myself.

I?ve tried to make peace with being cis female, but that doesn?t sit quite right. It?s like a jigsaw piece that looks like it should fit but belongs to a totally different part of the image. So you mash it into place and it KINDA works, but the shade of blue for that patch of sky is just slightly off and you had to force the edges and now it?s gotten a crease in it.

?Just? female isn?t quite right but ?genderqueer? is a step too far in the other direction. I don?t want/need my gender to be a huge deal. If I can present masculinely that?s all I need to be comfortable. I?d like smaller boobs or to bind so that I look more andro in public, but I don?t want neutral pronouns. She/her simply feels like home, even if I?d take a neutral passport marker in a heartbeat and cringe at the thought of ever being in a position of employment that would require people calling me ?Miss?/?Mrs?. I have few to no things that ?need? to change and it makes me wonder if I?m not off-center enough for it to be worth labelling myself. But more than that I want to understand my gender.

I have recently become very vocal about wanting my pronouns to be they/them. However, I am really having a hard time knowing when I need to get very serious with people in a profession or public situations. I think the big thing is being called sir...... I live in the south, so I don't know if I should cut my loses here. This has really been on my mind lately as I am really becoming more out and expressive of my identity.

I freaking love men. I thought I was bi for a while--I think deep down there are some parts of me that monosexuality can't explain--but at the moment I prefer the company of men. 

What really gets me is that I see men that I am undoubtedly attracted to, but at the same time would like to embody. Somehow, though, that makes the attraction all the stronger. 

Like, *the way he walks, how he holds himself, it's so masculine. I want to walk like that--and God he looks so good doing it.* 

Or, *The muscles in those arms. I want arms like that. But for now, I need him to put them around me and not let go.*

But what I think is interesting is that more masculine doesn't mean more attractive to me. In fact, I find myself  liking men who are rather shorter and stouter. That softer look, whether physically or in their characteristics. What that means, to me, is that I'm attracted to the same masculinity I strive for.

Something that I often fantasize about is my beau crying on my shoulder. But for me, that doesn't come at the expense of never being able to cry on his shoulder. I guess I want a relationship featuring expressive, emotional masculinity on the part of both of us.

Now I know the concept of gendered clothing itself sucks, but bear with me. My school farewell is a few days away, and I have to wear 'traditional' clothes, it being a formal occasion. My mom is very excited and has picked out a sari for me (this is India) and booked a hair styling and make up session. And I just... sigh and wish I could wear a suit like the guys.

I've gotten out of wearing 'girly' clothes so far by wearing jeans and T-shirts outside, and the school uniform on previous school events. But on the farewell, all the girls are expected to wear saris and glam up. The rest of my female friends no doubt look forward to it. The only topic of discussion among them right now is what they're gonna wear that day, where they bought their outfit from, and so on. Not me.

Thinking of that day makes me die a little on the inside. My dread of that day is like a constant buzzing pain in my head. I feel like I have to tell *someone* now, else I'll choke on my own emotions, which is what drove me to write this post. I am not looking forward to it, the unsolicited comments like  ""Oh, you look so pretty"", no doubt said with good intention, but entirely lost upon me. I stopped looking at mirrors long ago, cause I DON'T relate to the person I see there. I hope I don't cry when I see the final result of my makeover. 

But in a way though, I am curious to see how I react to my being dolled up that day. Will my dysphoria go poof, and never return, and I will live as a cis-woman happily ever after? Or will it confirm something I already knew, but never admitted to myself? Will it finally push me to stop pretending to be someone who I am not, and motivate me to fight for who I really am?

Talking about my gender has always been kind of an awkward subject for me because I guess I was never sure anyone would take me seriously. I don't totally agree with gender roles or labels, because the definitions of what is masculine and what is feminine always seemed arbitrary to me. And yet, I looked at what was considered ""masculine"", and concluded that even though there were some things I like about myself that I would consider such, by and large I don't really identify with it. I emotionally relate more closely with women, and on the inside I feel soft, sensitive, and feminine. Now that I've started digging into some of those feelings, I've realized I am much more comfortable expressing myself that way. Really though, I would rather just be able to express myself as whatever the hell I feel like. I'm told that's called gender-fluidity, which I have sometimes identified with in certain spaces, but I still formally identify as a male because it's easier to understand than whatever the hell I am.

I was towards the end of my high school career when I got to really understanding myself and my gender in this way. It was about the same time I started to experiment with wearing women's clothing. I've been doing it for long enough now that I have a small repository of women's clothing that I would either wear in my privacy or in the company of my best friend, who herself has gone a long way in helping me explore myself, helping me pick out clothes and letting me paint my toenails. When I dress up, I'll stay dressed up for a while, and then regret having to change back into my regular wear because it doesn't feel as comfortable. I don't dress up for very long or very often, partially because I'm usually not alone for long enough to dress up in my own space, and I only get to see my friend once every few months. The other reason is that it feels taboo, like I'm not supposed to be doing this because I'm physically a man and I wouldn't go out like this normally. I have taken measures to try and quash this feeling, including going to sleep in my women's clothes or posting pictures of myself in women's clothes on social media. It all seems in vain.

In terms of my physical appearance, I already have an established personal style; sort of an emo crossed with grunge look that I'm mostly content with. I would describe this appearance as masculine. And yet at the same time, I have this vision of myself as a lady that I'm obsessed with, and I've spent nights dreaming about it. It makes me feel insecure about my body, being that I have a very large upper build, facial hair and body hair that I neglect to shave at regular intervals, large hands and feet, and a noticeable belly (I'm not exactly the spitting image of health). It makes me feel like I could never achieve the feminine appearance I desire. I will look at images of other women and feel envious of their appearances. I struggled with basic self-care for a very long time because I felt so terribly about my body. I've seriously considered hormone replacement therapy. I don't consider any of these feelings to be actual dysphoria because I don't think I'm trans, though I could be wrong. Either way, I very much want to see myself as a woman in the same way I've seen myself as a man.

Truth be told, my growth was stunted for a long time because I never saw myself as ""good enough"" to challenge accepted definitions. I'm twenty years old now, and I only came out to my parents about all of the things about a month ago. I did so in hopes that I wouldn't have to feel ashamed of myself anymore. And now I'm actively working with my therapist to help me explore my feminine side. The more I dig into it, the more I feel like I could actually be transgender. And though maybe I'm expecting change to happen faster than it actually will, I'm still struggling to make it happen, and I would like to know what I can do to achieve congruence with my gender. I've been told that it's remarkable that I have such a deep understanding of myself given my age, but I could never really be sure if what I'm feeling is real. Whatever I am, I would like to rest assured that these feelings are valid and not something I've manufactured. I swear I'm not trying to run away from myself, I'm just trying to be myself.

If I had to go back and pick from the binary choices, I?d probably pick male again, but not because of identity, more for perks like male privilege, better treatment in my occupation (computer programming), and actually having pockets in my clothes.

I?m fine with male secondary characteristics. I have no desire to take on a more gender neutral appearance, even in private. I lift weights and have a fairly fit body that I?m happy with.

In terms of orientation, I?m mostly straight, maybe 1.5 on the Kinsey scale. Low sex drive, often submissive, and I like cuddles as much as sex. Porn is a turn off when there isn?t an emotional connection - a ton of porn is downright abusive, but that?s a topic for another time.

I have a very female appearance to the point that even when I shaved my head and never wore makeup I was still never thought of as male besides by the very old and blind librarians who immediately corrected themselves after hearing my voice.

This causes confusion for many people especially ones that I have recently met because I have whole new social groups now that I have moved.

that it was probably confusing when following that very short conversation that didn't give nearly enough time to explain anything.

This was the first time I wore painted nails out, I was terrified as I entered there, but luckily I only got some stares.

They told me they liked the message. When I told them I disliked the anti-gay stuff my mom told me that ""you know I believe in the bible, and that the bible says being gay is a sin"".  She also told me that she was ""probably wrong in this"" but she believed in gay marriage, because ""most of them are going to divorce anyway, but at least they can keep the kids"" (I have no idea what she meant by this, the argument she usually uses to defend her position to family goes something like ""If they're going to sin by being gay, at least they won't be promiscuous in marriage.""). She said that no matter how much she feels sympathy for them, they're still wrong. She said she can have her feelings but in the end she knows that it's wrong. She has a right to hold these opinions but I just want to share this, because she is the only person I have to rely on. She is the most accepting person I know.

She said ""You're a boy, you shouldn't be painting your nails"". I responded ""No, I'm non-binary."" She said ""Yeah, but... come on."" she rolled her eyes and then patted my head saying ""You are a boy"". My mom responded by saying ""This is just his college expression"" (She is the only person I know who will defend me. Even if her defenses still hurt they hurt less than the attacks of those around me. So we're very close.) I said ""No, this isn't just a phase, I'm non-binary."" To which my aunt responded ""Didn't you hear the message?"" (referring to the church service \[I'm an atheist too but she doesn't know that\]). ""At least say you like them."" my mom said. ""No, I'm not going to complement a \*boys\* nails."" Then my mom tried to defuse the situation by talking about things my aunt shouldn't have done when she was in college but I won't tell them here because even if she's ok with publicly embarrassing me I'm not ok with doing that.

I guess my first instances with gender were when I was super young, like 3-4 years old. At preschool, during recess, they would often play boy vs girl games. And half the time I'd go to the boy's side (I think at one point I'd even made a schedule -- Mondays and Wednesdays were boy days, and Fridays were girl days lol).    

My parents were, I'm guessing starting that age up until I was about 13, very against ""girly"" things. They said anything ""girly"" was stupid -- makeup, fashion, dolls, etc. (when I turned 13 or so, they started expecting me to be more girly, but i never did)

They're so tight but they work. It's still not enough tho... I had my arms in some pretty weird positions to try to cover the chest stuff lol.      

I've always hated dresses and skirts. They feel so wrong. But I'm autistic and have sensory issues, and any pants other than sweatpants are torture, so I've just learned to suffer being super uncomfortable while wearing skirts and dresses.

I've always been more masculine, and I don't really care about gender roles. In fact, I kinda take pride in smashing them lol. I like being ""that girl who smashes gender roles and acts like a dude"".

At first I thought it was just me having a complex about growing up. But I don't think it is (or at least, not all). I wish I had a more masculine body. i see pictures of cis men wearing suits and clotehs and everything, and I want to look like that. But I'm not trans. I don't have any lower dysphoria, and I definitely want to be as hairless as possible so I would freak out if I got any more hair lol.      

Idk. This is all super confusing. It's like... I want people to see me as a girl. But I want to have a sexless body and I want to get misgendered.

My best friend and I aren't officially dating or anything, but we're both openly interested in each other and pretty romantically and sexually involved. For anonymity, let's call him Jeff.

So, Jeff here has always considered himself straight. He's definitely attracted to women, but funnily enough, never dated one. He's dated two afab nonbinary people though, one transmasc though not ftm, and one was more femme. Additionally, I'm afab and agender. He's never dated a trans woman but he wouldn't rule it out, and he finds some of them attractive, given that he's into women. He's not into trans men or cis men. Not sure on his stance on amab enbys, though he made a passing comment of ""they're cute"" about one I dated if that counts for anything.

He's honestly quite the ally. Incredibly spportive of his LGBT+ pals, and I have no doubts when he says that he he sees trans men as men, trans women as women, and nonbinary people as, well, nonbinary, that he's 100% sincere.

Now here's what the post is about again of course. He isn't pan, he doesn't feel like identifying as bi fits him, but he doesn't feel right claiming to be straight either given his attraction to and relationships with nonbinary people. He's not a chaser or anything either. He considered himself heteroflexible for awhile, but dropped that because he thought no one would take him seriously. I've assured him he doesn't need to label himself and that his feelings are perfectly valid, but he says he'd be far more comfortable with ""knowing what he is"".

When I was around 11 I started to ?steal? my sisters new bra or underwear when they got home from shopping and my mom always assumed that they left it at the store on accident. I would try them on but then quickly felt like I was doing something terrible and threw them away. 

When I moved out on my own I started to explore things but only panties and sports bras, I just assumed it was a fetish of sorts. After that I started looking at clothing online but I was alway too scared to actually order them online.  I still don?t understand why it was easy for me to buy a hot pink sports bra at the self checkout but I couldn?t bring myself to order online. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago when I heard my sister explaining genderfluidity to someone and it just clicked in my brain. I came out to her and one of my other sisters who I knew would support me a couple weeks later. Not long after that I started to actually order clothing off sites (mostly underwear and lingerie that I could wear under my boy clothing and no one would notice) and at that point I thought I?d figured it out and I was good.

Not even close, over the past year I?ve started getting more and more clothing and I?m starting to wear less men?s clothing. I?m still closeted other than maybe 6 people so I still present male in public and even around those I?m out with because I worry about how I look. But I don?t remember the last time I wore men?s jeans, I wear jeggings exclusively now but I alter how they come across by having them rest on my waist for a feminine look or my hips for a looser masculine look. I don?t wear men?s underwear unless there?s a chance someone might see it. I wear leggings under my pants any time I can?t wear my jeans. For the past couple months I?ve mostly been wearing women?s shirts with a hoodie thrown over it. I?m kind of worried about what I?ll do when it starts to get warmer and I can?t hide things so easily. However every now and then I do feel super masculine and wear men?s clothing(I still wear the jeggings though because they?re fucking comfortable and men?s jeans are terrible). 

I don?t think I?m trans because while there are times I wish I had a vagina and could openly present that way, I also really like my penis and I know I?d eventually regret my decision. I?m starting to feel some major dysphoria about it all.

When writing about this, it feels stupid, because I know that gender is a construct and whatnot, but I also don't really feel like a member of the lgbq community because, even though I identify as queer, I don't really know enough queer people to say that I feel like I belong. I often feel like I would very much like to be a woman. I'm attracted to women, but the idea of being a woman and being with a woman as a woman (if that makes sense) is incredible. I don't really know how to explain this intense desire I have. I'm sorry this is so rambly, but I've never really tried to write about it or talk about it at length before.

I guess I'm curious as to how I can look more androgynous, and how to feel comfortable doing it. I live in NYC, so no one but me really gives a shit what I look like, but I still have this pervasive sense of what's probably homophobia whenever I want to do something outside of my comfort zone. I paint nails now, which is nice, and I hate when they're unpainted, and I want to get more into makeup. My partner is super supportive and encourages me to wear her clothes and things like that, but my silhouette ends up being so clearly masculine that I hate it. No curves!

Can anyone relate to what I'm saying? I feel like I'm not queer enough, as though it's something that has to be earned. Almost like I'm not allowed to be trans, although I believe pretty firmly I'm not. I think, ideally, I'd want to switch between man and woman at will, but obviously that's not possible. I don't know. I'm confused and I want to figure it out and feel comfortable in my expression and feel like myself.

* i was questioning about my gender. im a feminine 18 yo AMAB. eventually i decide not to go on HRT and here is my reasoning.
* i found this article. turns out gayness is not genetic defect. it's a useful trait in evolution. in plain words, for example if you have a 60% girly brain, you can easily make friends with girls and your reproduction success boosts(because essentially you are a girl inside). this is how your ancestors pass down their gene. and you can repeat the same process. you are a fucking winner in the genetic battle, you have the ultimate weapon. you are perfect. it's a blessing in disguise.
* society's expectation of ""manly man"" is dumb. only idiot blindly follows it unexamined. you know what, society also want to you be to a workhorse, work hard and pay tax until you die, are you gonna follow that expectation? there are a lot of wrong messages in life from different people you got to filter it with your reasoning and some faith.
* you don't need to be on E to be a girly ""girl"" and a ""Mom"". if you run a business like a company, build products, or make arts such as music, the business or company, the products, the songs/art are your babies. they are yours. you will spend years or decades to take care of them until they grow up and are able to take care of themselves. you are still their mom by then. you are the business girl, music/art girl, or gamer girl. [you are your babies mom](https://youtu.be/ML_Wk4dedww?t=224). if you do everything a mom would do for her babies then you are the mom. genetically you are predisposed to be a mom. don't waste your potential.
* you can also be mom to your biological babies. cook for them, make sure they are eating healthy, talk, listen, spend time with them. genetically you will be more motherly and patient to your children than all the other dudes and girls.
* defines your own success, femininity and masculinity. if you found your love, won people's respect, made good money, shower your kids with love and guidance, have a healthy body, you are a fucking success. your girlfriend is gonna love you. she's gonna so be happy that her SO is also her BFF. there's not many male in the crowds that has the natural ability to be BFF with girls.",1,1549267825.0,amzm8o,0,genderqueer

(Well, easier) I moved away from where I grew up and got a whole lot queerer, but three weeks ago I moved in with my parents and... It's been uncomfortable.

Everyone still wants to use he/him or (much more often) she/her and I'm realizing I feel like I can't correct them anymore. With she/her it was different; I pretty much knew people would take me seriously and get the idea when I said it, but that certainty evaporated when I came back as something less neat and conforming. Most people just won't get it, I know how cis (and many trans) people talk about us, and even when they're supportive they don't think about it the same way as they do with binary trans people.

I can't correct them because now its superficial. I'm not a ""woman trapped in a man's body"" anymore; I'm something less serious and important even to the people who I know will go along with my pronouns. I can read it way too clearly on their faces, and that might honestly be more painful than them getting it wrong. 

The real reason I don't correct people though is because if I start doing it I'm also starting a timer until I hit a snag. I'll always be waiting on the other shoe to drop, because it *will*, (and probably quickly) when I finally hit someone who'll make it a big deal, someone unafraid of announcing that they just don't get it and challenging me. In that moment I'm not going to have the wherewithall to be an educator, and that'll cause a lot more pain than the sum total of misgendering.

So I shut up and take the she/her lumps I asked for, I guess. I... Don't really have a point here. I'm just upset.

I feel fine calling myself a ""woman"" but I don't necessarily feel like only a woman or like the ""woman"" I am expected to be. Wearing skirts or dresses makes me want to crawl out of my skin. It makes me so uncomfortable, just thinking about it makes me feel physically disgusted. The last time I put on a dress was for my sister's wedding and before then, the last time was over 7 years ago. I also hate knowing/thinking about that I have a uterus, and sometimes I think I would prefer having a penis and I daydream about having a penis during sex. I don't hate having a vagina and labia  (it's really the uterus that disgusts me--I used to feel uncomfortable with a vagina), but some days I would prefer a penis. Pregnancy all around also disgusts me and even thinking about ever being pregnant makes my skin crawl.

Then it's like well if not now then when.

828,2328,"Before I start, I want to clarify a few things about why I am making this post.

Talking about indifference, apathy, pomogender etc. at length might be uncharted territory for a lot of communities. People talking about this are few and far between (considering the few people who do find it worth their time to talk about it). Some definitions of apathy describe it very similar to gender non-conformity but I think there are enough differences with the mindset and behavior to differentiate it.

I thought it would be helpful to add my two cents to the understanding of indifference. I'm not be best case study; I'm in early stages of defining what I am and others may have drastically differing experiences later in their journey. Also my platonic behavior might be tied to asexual traits but I think there are enough differing traits to make a distinction.

I am not making the claim that indifferents are a suppressed individuals; based on my lifestyle, indifference is probably inconsequential in my society. Also, I'm not trying to claim that pronouns are unimportant; pronouns/roles are very important, they ascribe internal/external qualities, have a social function and they make English the convoluted lovable trashy language that it is.

With that out of the way, I hope you find that my perspective gives some more light on the topic. I would love to hear differing opinions and experiences regarding this (if you are willing).

Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm 24 years old.

Not too long ago, I publicly told the void that  ""I'm indifferent to my gender"". What I wrote took me aback. I had to ask myself, am I actually questioning my gender or am I just at odds with how society expects archetypal male traits from me?

I'm born male. I look like a male, I walk and talk like a male and that's okay... I guess... I don't feel the urge to change my appearance to more butch or fem. I always lived comfortably in this body so I might keep it this way. I don't mind people deliberately misgendering me, in some scenarios it can be endearing. I look after kids a lot of the time so ""aunty"" or ""koka"" (Te Reo for aunty) is appropriate sometimes. If you wanna be endearing and call me gal, girlfriend, dude, guy, bro or sis, that's cool. If an ass tries to call me miss, maam mistress mrs, or lady, I'm not entirely phased. For my use, titles and pronouns have either a sentimental or utilitarian function. Apart from the descriptive use I don't demand titles cause they are like tools to me; not for socio-political reasons, just that my birth-sex doesn't play a part in how I interact or exchange in my community. I can fit comfortably in a lot of groups; whether be a circle of aunties, a bunch of farming blokes, sisters getting together for a reality TV marathon, it hasn't much consequence, there is no lynch mob from me gardening or taking up pottery instead of hunting.

Now this is where I talk about some of my asexual traits. I may not be giving a complete picture of what indifference is; but I should probably mention it.

I never really felt the desire to explore my sexuality with other people. Some people might brush me off as a virgin (that's okay, I'm fine with that) but when I picture desire or attraction with others, I can only see platonic romantic interactions with people. I have a drive, I have visual cues for attraction but it's not how I actually desire for relationships.

&#x200B;

In summary, what do I feel like?

I am biologically and chemically male but being male ranges from being fine to meaningless to me. My personality comes from something deeper in my soul, something that flows through all forms of me.

I am into androgynous people for sure, but I sometimes am into guys or girls. When I feel like a boy, I would be gay, attracted to people of the same gender, because it'd feel natural to me, and this happens when I feel like a girl, I would be lesbian. However, in this fluidity, when I am in the ""in-between"" those two areas, I'd stop seeing people are gendered beings, just agendered persons, and in parallel, I'd wonder if I'm ace or grey. I identify primarily as ""fluid androgynous"", a term I just made up, because so far it describes myself best. Anyways, that being said, if I come to feel sexual attraction in my androgynous nonbinary moments, it'd be to androgynous people.

836,2336,"So it's late. I just laid down to sleep after comforting a sick friend/roommate with a cuddle and a temple massage. And it struck me that as an AMAB, this would be contextualized differently than if I'd been born female. And I got to thinking about a lot of things that for me is just friendship that others would see as something else.


As a guy, this would be something reserved for a romantic interest. A lot of affectionate displays and comforting others would be. Even something like hugging is viewed that way. Like my nephew. He's 8 now and doesn't like goodbye hugs anymore. But my two nieces I couldn't leave without at least three. 


Being gender queer makes how I express affection and how it is perceived awkward at times. I'm never quite sure what the protocol is. People who are more accepting don't have as big of a problem with things like hugs or kisses on the head. But I've seen it cuts both ways. AFABs who prefer handshakes also seem uncomfortable when hugged at times. It's a barrier whichever side of queer someone is on.


I try not to let it get to me. The other day I went to a Leann Chin and a girl there was new and was flustered. As a customer I asked if she wanted a hug. She almost burst into tears and said ""YES!"" and we hugged and gave our names. That's not something two guys would do. But it felt natural to me.


That's the thing about gender though. Sometimes it's hard to tell where identity ends and personality begins. Am I just a touchy feely person or is it because that's what's expected, or is it forced unconsciously. I don't have good answers. But to me, handshake or hug was
a bigger question than what bathroom to use. At work, guessing wrong could be seen as sexual harassment. But doing neither comes off as aloof or cold. 


It also struck me how we interact with friends can be so
different. Two girls can kiss goodbye and nobody thinks twice. Or netflix and curling up on each other. Two guys and they have to be gay. Or sit on opposite sides of the couch. But what about non binary people? It might seem like they're picking a ""side"". And it's common to hear people comment like ""well, if he wants to be a guy, he shouldn't do that."" What if they're just more affectionate? What if it's a personal choice of personality instead of social identity? Shouldn't that be validated too? Does it have to mean more?


There's no guide on where the boundaries are. Often times it feels like I'm just blundering around in ambiguity.  Can I cuddle a sick friend? Should I offer? How would it come off? These are questions I ask often, things that for other people it would be obvious. And it can be jarring to do what feels natural to me but the other person gets awkward about.


But as awkward as it can sometimes be, choosing to be affectionate instead of safely remaining distant is a choice I'll keep making. I don't know if it makes me more of a woman, less of a man, or just is who I am. I just know that it's a colder, harder world to always pick the safe choice. To remain gender neutral in a world that does its best every day to make me choose a side is a hard fight. And sometimes I don't give a damn what side I'm on.


I just want to feel alive. To be a part of the world, even if it doesn't have a place for me. To participate in the story of life, in all its delicious ambiguity... To me, is worth, any price. Life is too short to wait until I've answered all the questions. Sometimes I just have to jump, and hope I'll find the answer on the way. But I'd be a liar if I told you I knew what I was doing.

I would say that the way we label gender just doesn't work with me--I don't feel female or male or anything. Sure, I use female bathrooms and I check ""female"" on forms, but I'm most comfortable when I don't have to answer the question. To put it simply, I am and am not a girl in the same way that I am and am not a boy. Since the world tells me the parts I have mean ""girl"", I say I'm a ""girl"", but I don't know if I'm really attached to that.

All this is to say, does liking men make me straight? I've sent a long time debating my sexual orientation. I felt I was bi for a while but ultimately it didn't feel right. I accepted that I like men, but I resented the term ""straight"". The image conjured up by ""straight girl"" didn't feel like me, it strikes me as very cisnormative. But if that's the case, should I adopt it to help change the idea of straightness?

The other term I like is achillean--someone masculine of center who is attracted to other masculine of center people. That resonates with me, but it feels like I might be trying to appropriate queerness by using a fancy term.

I fear it will become more difficultif they look less female toblend into my traditional place in society with them as my partner witch raises a whole host of stuggles/questions.

sorry for the whining and the throwaway account but I've been in a not so good place recently.
Just a lot of venting

Like the title says, I genuinely hate being nonbinary and all the assumptions that come with it.

My identity is not a political statement.

I'm not proud of my indentity (though I support people who are) and have no desire to ""shove it in people's faces"" as the transphobes like to say. I just don't have the luxury of being stealth, and therefore, will ALWAYS have to choose between severe dysphoria or being out.

I have atypical and likely incurable dysphoria. It can probably be lessened, but not eliminated. It's my burden to carry for my whole life. I have a right to bitch about it.

I don't demand special treatment like cis people seem to think. I just want equal treatment, and I'm not even provided with that.

Terfs seem to have this idea that all afab transpeople are trans because ""the patriarchy!!!"" and ""misogyny!!!"" but I have an atypical experience here too. I don't suffer from internalized misogyny (mostly because I'm not a woman, but yknow), but I've also somehow never been a victim of misogyny or any type of oppression, discrimination, or harrassment because of my AGAB. Given that I've somehow avoided those factors, why would they be my motive to transition?

A lot of cis people seem to believe that my identity is based solely on stereotypes. It has nothing to do with that at all. I've always been a little more masc leaning. Why couldn't I just be a gender nonconforming girl? Because Im not a girl. God I wish I could be a girl, I really do, but I'm not. 

A lot of binary trans people are under the impression I'm a ""transtrender"" because ""nonbinary people don't have dysphoria and just claim to be trans to fit in""

chest dysphoria

I don't give a damn about challenging gender or enforcing/not enforcing stereotypes.
That's not it at all.

I'm not ""confused"" I'm just agender.

I want to be stealth so bad but it can never happen if I want to be happy.

I'm 23 and AFAB. I've been shedding a lot of internalized heteronormativity these past few years, and in doing so there's been a lot of closeted/buried feelings and issues that have come to light in full force since I've paid more attention to my inner voice(vs the internalized voices from my parents and the rest of the world), if any of that makes sense?

One of the biggest issues was how much I hated my large chest as a kid, and looking at myself in the mirror causes a lot of grief. I developed really early in elementary school and along with being an asexual who was sexualized at a young age, there's just a lot of mess there... A lot of distain for my body. I remember girls wanting to stuff their bras with tissues and all I wanted to do was wrap Saran wrap around my chest. All the shitty comments from my narc mother about my large chest, boys poking and grabbing and laughing, girls saying they wish they had what I have, saying I should be grateful for what I was born with, etc etc... I feel disgusted with my own body and my hatred wants me to chop them off completely. But I still have days where I really like seeing my feminine body in the mirror, I like how I look in some dresses and feeling feminine is just as much a part of me as wanting to chop my boobs off with a guillotine.

Any case, I'm taking a shot and trying binding for the first time to see if that helps minimize the sickness I feel towards my body on days where I'm not comfortable seeing a female figure. My problem is, I'm worried about the largeness of my chest, if binding doesn't work the way I want it to(large boobs being binded still show enough boob to look feminine vs masculine) and if it will harm any tissues at all by binding(last time I measured my size I was 36GG and I'm worried about the large size). Would it be worth it to actually get a substantial reduction instead of binding first? I'm an incredibly sweaty person and also wondering if using Gold Bond while binding would help with any discomfort there.

870,2370,"So since the middle of last year, I have been very confused as to what my actual gender is. I am 23 and AMAB.To give some story, it started when one of my BFFs told me that most of my mannerisms (the way I acted around them) was mostly feminine. At that point, I was both shocked and (I guess) happy at the same time that my friends perceived me as that. Since then, I first bought colored nail polish as to enjoy wearing nail polish and breaking the stigma that ""guys should not wear nail polish unless it's clear. I bought it both for the appeal and because I had a bad habit of chewing on my nails, so this helped out a lot. Once I got comfortable with wearing nail polish, I soon started buying more colors to try wearing (mostly different shades of blue and white).Few months later, next thing I know my mind gravitates buying mostly feminine outfits than masculine outfits, mostly because I could never find anything appealing to me that just says ""Wow, this would look pretty on me"". So about August/September of 2018 is when I started buying more feminine outfits. I was still buying masculine outfits for everyday wear, just not as much. Today every time I go clothes shopping, I mostly just go towards the ladies section and shop there first before the mens section.Back in early November 2018, I went to an Ulta Beauty store and asked one of the hair dressers in the Salon area about possibly giving me a pixie style haircut. After looking at some pictures on Pinterest and seeing the many styles and how interesting they looked, I really wanted to see how well a hair style like those would work on me. They told me that my hair would need to be long enough in order to get the results that I want. Last I spoke to them was 3 weeks ago. So hopefully next week I'll be able to go back in there and ""maybe"" get my hair cut the way I'd like to go for.Since November of 2018, I have also shaved my legs, chest and arm hair because I feel as though body hair just gets in the way and especially with my body, most of my chest hair was really ""belly"" hair and to me just looking disgusting if you are trying to impress other people. And just in general, I really hated it. While shaving my belly hair, I figured I'd shave my upper chest hair and then shave my legs and arm hair. Shaving my legs (to me) was a blessing because now my legs feel smoother than ever, even if I have to shave them again every once in a while (same goes for the rest). I also shave my face every other day because someone who's feminine does not/should not have facial hair (plus I've just never really liked it).Last month I bought makeup (lipstick, lip liner, foundation, primer, a facial brush, sponge, mirror, and removal wipes) and a makeup bag to put it all of my makeup and nail polish in. I've also considered moving my feminine clothes out from a box just strictly for them into the rest of my masculine wardrobe so that I can wear some masculine things one day and possibly a feminine outfit the next or vice versa.I've also consider about possibly going on HRT and transition myself to look more feminine.I have not yet ""come out"" to my parents, whom I would like for them to be the first ones to hear about it before I really confirm anything else to anyone, whether it be friends, other family members, etc.  So in short, out of what I have said here, I'd just like to know if my ""assigned gender"" has changed every since I've considered myself a cisgender male. I'd like to believe that I could be either androgynous or a Transfeminine, but I'd like to get some feedback/ideas/input from y'all as to what y'all think my real gender could be. Yes, I do understand that finding out my real gender is something that should be explored by myself, but I have done some research and I figure if I post something like this here, that I could possibly get some answers/advice.  TL/DR: Friend tells me that I act like a girl and so I've been acting more lady-like to the point of wanting to wear things that women would wear, even to the point of deciding to get a feminine hair cut soon and wearing makeup.",1,1547798040.0,ah884v,5,genderqueer

- Wearing heels after leg day is a very bad idea
- Women live longer than men unless you count the difference in time spent in the bathroom; I did the math. I didn't include time spent waiting in line. 
- Jeans for men are comfy even when meant to be snug.
- Jeans for women have been known to cause temporary paralysis. 
- Women really do have a better sense of smell. It has to be hormones because F2Ms douse themselves with Axe too and are oblivious.
- Men say ""oops!"" and women say ""oop!"" ... and I don't know why this difference exists.
- It can break someone's brain when they can't work out someone's gender. Like, CTRL+ALT+DEL... some people just freeze up.
- Youtube is full of lies. It's always harder than it looks. *Always*.
- Almost nobody thinks they're sexist. 
- Almost everyone thinks they're accepting/tolerant.
- Everyone is wrong about the last two. 
- I broke down for no apparent reason in the cat food aisle awhile back. None of my (female) friends thought this was in any way unusual or noteworthy. As a guy, this would have been a cause for great concern -- now it's Tuesday. I'm the same person. 
- As a guy, when I went to the doctor and said I was in pain, they ordered tests, asked lots of questions, and referred me to numerous experts.
- As a woman, I'm pretty much on my own unless I have a sucking chest wound and am literally spewing blood all over their shoes. 
- Men's sizing is quantifiable and objective. Women's sizing is a fractal shit show.
- Example -- Men: Boxers or briefs. 
- Women: **?**?^t? pv? / m?-(pt)d? = v?ln(m?-m?))+v?ln(m? - 0)
- Men resolve conflict a lot better than women do. Two men can get into a fight, a few punches are exchanged, and they'll head off and have beers after like nothing happened. Two women get in a fight and it's fucking WW3 with both of them shitting in the other's souls. 
- I never used to apologize for getting into the elevator, but now I do. I don't know why. 
- In 2010, everyone was talking about gay rights. In 2015, everyone talked about which bathroom to use. In 2019, it's which pronouns to use. I expect that by 2025 we'll use pronouns in public about as often as 'fuck', marriage will be something only people ""who live in the sticks"" do, and I'm not sure how I feel about any of it.
- But everybody wants my opinion about these things... like I'm the ambassador of 'Genderica'.
- Guys seem happiest in jeans and a t-shirt. Women seem happiest with PJs and liquor.

________
I've had a friend for a long time, and value her friendship. But thanks to being bi (I suspect), I have passing thoughts of being more than friends with just about everyone (including her) because most of the qualities I like in my friends, I also like in my partners (go figure). It's a running joke -- ""We can't be friends with anyone.. .there are no friends, there is only prey. We are... the bilociraptors. Screeeeee!"" 


Being trans/GQ though adds an extra dimension to it, and along with it the crippling self-doubt and low self-esteem. What do I really have to offer anyone? Could anyone love me? I'm sure you all get the idea. So sometimes it's hard separating my own self-doubt, sexuality, and getting at what I'm ""really"" feeling here. I don't feel strongly sexually attracted to pretty much everyone, or that might point me in a direction. Plot twist: My friend is also bi and GQ, but unlike me has no interest in transitioning, etc. (she is AFAB, I am AMAB). 


I'm just wondering how other people sort through all this, because most of the queer community still has some scripts to go off of, and their communities and social expectations are clearer. Being *gender* queer though adds an extra dimension to sexuality that has always been ill-defined and confusing to me. Specifically, that there's no sharp delineation between them. Gender identity is interwoven into sexuality, and when both are fluid, it makes separating romantic interest from friendship a lot harder. Tie that in with the barrage of other emotions that come up, and it can be almost impossible, for me at least, to tell where the boundaries are, or even what I'm feeling.

And I know this is very important to people?s identities so I mean this question just out of my own lack of understanding of gender as a concept and of my own gender. But I feel like since you can be any gender and have any body parts and express yourself in any way gender identity itself has no meaning to me? And like I don?t understand what it means to feel like a woman. I?m afab and I feel like my ?woman? experiences are related to that I have certain body parts and experience the oppression/violence of walking through the world perceived as a woman and I feel that violence contributes to a strong part of my identity. But the person I was talking this through with said that I don?t understand the feeling of not feeling the right gender because I?ve never had to think about it as a supposedly cis person and that I never had a problem with puberty and all that. But then I felt very upset and emotional unexpectedly because that?s not actually true. I was really upset at puberty when I started getting boobs.

We have a lot of mutual non-work friends, too, and it's likely I'll be spending time with him off the clock in the future. Is it weird if I change my name to the name he already has? Should I talk to him first? Should I try to find a different name? His name isn't common.

I?m AMAB, and while I don?t have a particularly strong reaction to my given name, there?s a common girl?s name I?ve wanted since I was a kid. Though I?ve never told anyone, I?ve long thought of it internally as my name, and when I hear the name spoken, I can?t help but look up or think of it being my own name, and I can?t think of the name, or of someone who has the name, without associating it with myself.

I?m always read as male, and while that?s a little annoying, I?m generally okay with my appearance most of the time.

I guess another thing is that I never disliked my birth name enough to figure changing my name was worth the trouble.

Nonetheless, as time goes on, I can?t help but think of the ""girl name"" as the name that best suits me.

I'm female assigned at birth; never felt weird being called a ""she"" or a ""girl"" (I'm sure it helped that my parents let me follow my own interests as a child, many of which would probably be considered more ""masculine""). I did freak out when I hit puberty and started growing breasts, though; I felt so uncomfortable about it and about having to start wearing bras, but I just assumed that was normal.

I'm fortunate that I must have a lot of androgens, or something, because as I've continued to grow into adulthood (I'm 28) I've found that I'm a lot more comfortable with how my body has developed. My breasts are small - barely an A cup - so I almost never wear a bra unless I'm working out; then I wear a sports bra which I'm a lot more comfortable with anyway. I can wear a T-shirt and a men's button-down (my preferred look) and my chest is barely noticeable. The proportions of my body are more like a small (5'4"") man than a woman - relatively broad shoulders, long torso, square hips, a subtle but visible Adam's apple (yes, some women do have these). I also have a lot of leg hair and a bit of a happy trail that's been slowly filling in over the last few years.

I wear almost exclusively men's clothing, and I feel happiest and most confident when I have a short men's haircut - a fact I discovered only 6 or 7 months ago when I specifically asked for my hair to be cut in a men's style rather than simply saying I wanted my hair cut short and showing my hairdresser pictures of what I had in mind. Even though all my photo references were men, he had been ""adapting"" them slightly to feminize them which isn't what I wanted. He was totally happy to cut my hair in a men's style when I brought it up, but somehow hadn't realized that was what I had wanted before.

I don't feel like I need to have top surgery or take T to be comfortable in my body, though I do wish I could grow a beard because I LOVE the aesthetic (really, what I want is that stubble look - mmm). I have ample peach fuzz, but it's largely invisible, and the faintest trace of a mustache. For the past few months I've been taking biotin for hair, skin and nail health, and I've noticed just a couple of darker hairs starting to pop up and my sideburn peach fuzz feels thicker recently, too. My lovely, supportive wife got me an electric razor and some beard balm for Christmas, which is awesome because a) some of my peach fuzz is long enough that I can trim it down with the 3mm setting and it feels like gentle stubble, and b) the beard balm seems to enhance that effect, as well as making the hairs just the tiniest bit more prominent. I told her I've started to cultivate an ""invisi-beard."" We also just started taking magnesium glycinate because like many Americans, we are both magnesium deficient. I didn't learn this until after I started taking it, but it also helps with hair health and growth, so I have my fingers crossed that maybe I'll continue to see some small changes.

I don't really mind that I won't grow a full beard because I do also like the way I look without facial hair, but I would like to make my peach fuzz fuller and thicker as much as I can. (It would never be worth it for me to go on T just to get facial hair, particularly because I love my full, thick head of hair and male-pattern baldness is strong in my family.) In private I sometimes like to put on fake facial hair, and this past Halloween I discovered the ""apply fiber mascara to your peach fuzz"" stubble look and I fell in love with the idea that I can ""enhance"" my existing facial hair to create stubble that is actually ""mine"". This was my Halloween look:

[For those of you wondering, yes, I am dressed as Captain Hook from Once Upon A Time. My wife went as Emma Swan.](https://i.redd.it/sm92xy20t2721.jpg)

[A better view of how this look appears up close. No Hook costume this time, lol.](https://i.redd.it/b2m7q19qt2721.jpg)

But even with all of this, my identity as a woman - or at least, someone with a ""female"" body - is important to me. I've found that as I've become more comfortable with expressing my masculinity and with the idea that, hey, I might want to start presenting to the world at large with mascara-enhanced facial hair sometimes, I've also become more and more certain that I want to continue to use ""she/her"" pronouns. In a sense, I think this is because I feel like a man and a woman, or a ""female who happens to also be male"" -- and with my presentation already skewed heavily masculine, I guess it my pronouns are the space in which I want my femaleness to be acknowledged.

Unlike other transmasculine individuals I have seen speak out, the label ""lesbian"" doesn't feel wrong or weird to me - in fact, I strongly identify with it, which is probably also part of why I still prefer ""she"". My wife has been very supportive of my gender exploration and in fact, says she knew I was non-binary long before I did (which makes sense, given that she's been calling me her ""wifesband"" since our newlywed days). She is bisexual but homo-romantic, so she says that I'm the best of both worlds because she sort of gets both in one person.

Although I prefer ""she"", I don't mind when strangers call me ""he"" or ""sir"" and generally don't correct them. It can be fun to be read as a he! It can also be stressful though, like when every airport employee going through security called me ""sir"" and then on my way to the airport women's room I suddenly thought, ""Shit, so many people are reading me ""male"" today; what if I run into trouble in the restroom?"" (I like both ""she"" and ""he"" more than ""they"", but ""she"" feels more right despite how I want to present myself.)

I suspect that if I do go out into the world with my mascara facial hair, people will either see me as a cis male, or read me as an FTM person who is transitioning. There are of course some women who grow facial hair and choose to let it grow (i.e. Harnaam Kaur), but they generally present feminine enough otherwise that they are still gendered as female.

If you've gotten this far, thanks for reading! I wanted to both put my voice out there as someone who identifies as transmasculine but wants to continue using female pronouns, as well as find out whether anyone else here feels similarly (or is maybe the opposite - transfeminine but wants to use male pronouns).

The doctor I went to for testing was awesome and was absolutely convinced I had it cause I present almost all the symptoms except having boobs (but I'm only 30 and that still may change however I look like I'm in my early 20s). Especially the mental ones. So after an initial negative result he went back and did multi site biopsies and ended up finding it hidden in my body.

But all 3 chromosomes are fully formed for the most part except the Y is damaged on both the XXY and XY (however the SR9 gene is intact so I somewhat had puberty...ish...with a second feminizing one in my early 20s where I dropped a lot of weight, my hips widened, and my fat distribution changed). Which has left me in a weird place hormone wise. Estrogen is through the roof...almost triple that of a normal male...testosterone is just at the low end of the normal line. However I'm lucky in the sense I don't have a lot of the negative side effects from it aside from lack of bulk muscle, wide hips, near zero sperm count, and fat distribution favoring my legs,thighs, and ass. It's to the point he kinda joked with me when asking about HRT if I wanted to look like a girl or guy.

I've always been feminine acting. From interests to social responses. That's just how I've always been. I've usually been quite happy with it. Especially now as an adult. It gives me a unique view of the world and I love it.

Then go shopping with me.""

Every relationship I've had has been with a woman, non-binary, or trans individual who was bi, bi-curious, lesbian, or mainly identified as sapphic (only into women). Who all 'found me attractive because I was ""Feminine"" and didn't set off typical masculine alarm bells in their head' (their words...not mine). But this has created problems too as I've been left before cause I ""wasn't manly enough"" and told to ""stop acting like a girl"".

But...the lack of social acceptance has been...weighing hard on me lately. I see posts on reddit in the lgbt subreddits how much people dislike feminine ""guys"" and I see it in real life too. The adjustment period when making new friends is difficult. Cause people have to get used to not treating me socially like a guy.

As I grew up, I started to shop in the boys section at stores. Sure, I still considered myself a girl in elementary school. I still had my long blonde hair, but I was a tomboy. I liked hanging out with the boys in my grade, and while I did have friends who were girl, they were very athletic and disliked things conventionally liked by girls. 

When I made it to middle school, I moved away from the kids I grew up with. I wanted to fit in, and I was going through puberty. I started wearing dresses and skirts. I started playing softball, and to avoid being called slurs like ?dyke?, I wore bows in my hair.  To get along with the girls on my team and my girl friends, I started acting different. I hated myself. I was catty and boy crazy. It felt so wrong, but my friends were the same way. I didn?t want to stand out. 

Then one day, I was standing on the foul line with my hand over my heart with the National Anthem  playing. I was staring shamelessly at the other team?s asses lined up facing the flag. I had never realized how attracted I was to both men and women. It made me different. I was different, and I had never realized how deep I was into what society deemed as normal. So, I stopped. I stopped hiding myself. I let the real me who didn?t care about what others thought come out again.

However I'm coming to realise that whilst at times I like expressing male and others female I am becoming more uncomfortable with being physically male.

I thought that because I was amab, that this meant that I had to transition to female. I was privileged to have access to hormones and therapy, but now that I'm nearly 2 and a half years into transition I can't ignore the fact that I hate stereotypically ""womanly"" self presentation. I would really stress out about makeup, even though I was good at it. I also hated heels, dresses, and even long hair (but kept it long because I was afraid of being visibly trans). I would normally wear sweaters and jean, and I was lucky that I passed really well as a cis woman, but that's just it, I don't feel like a woman at all.

I have considered that I might be a butch woman - but the woman part makes this designation not fit either. Is it possible to be dysphoric and trans when it comes to sex (or sexual characteristics about the body) and not about gender? Furthermore, am I transfeminine because of my desire to have a female body, or transmasculine because of my desire to appear masculine? I don't think this is due to internalized homophobia or some sexualized fetishization of female bodies either because I'm definitely asexual and aromantic too.

And ever since that realization I've started to notice these things even more.

So essentially my question is, are these valid thoughts or am I reading too much into things?

Some background on me:

- I?m AFAB and questioning my gender identity at the moment. I feel much more comfortable with femme presentation around my girlfriend (a cis lesbian), partly because she?s wonderfully supportive and partly because being in a queer relationship takes some of the pressure of traditional gender roles away.

- I studied abroad in Jordan last summer (I?m an Arabic/Middle Eastern History Major, so I?ve been trying to spend as much time in the Middle East as possible), and one thing I noticed was that I felt extremely gendered, all the time. Part of this is certainly my bias as an American who?s been told for years that ?Islam oppresses women,? and I?m not proud of that. At the same time, I?m wary of returning to a region where, broadly speaking, gender and sexuality are taboos, without most of my support system.

I don't wanna talk about that here. Rather, that I mentioned I was trying to 'gay up' my apartment, and suddenly people were coming out of the woodwork to say ""Why do gay people have to..."" whatever. It's like simply acknowledging or acting gay is somehow an overt political act. The comments section was jammed up with this kind of commentary. And this happens whenever something I write on Reddit that references the fact that yes, I'm queer. In real life too; They're mirrors of each other.


It's the same with being gender queer. I've had a lot of people suggest to me I'm just doing it for attention, or to ""make a statement"", and this bothers me. I feel like they're adding a political dimension to it that isn't there. ""Why does she have to mention that she's transgender *all the time*?"" is a common refrain. Even my parents were like ""It's not that I don't love you, it's just I don't know how to *explain* you."" As though I somehow need a special introduction; That without some kind of apology I'm not allowed to be in that space. Why do I need to be introduced as ""And this is [NAME], who is transgender."" Nevermind I'm not entirely comfortable with that label either -- I've just given up telling people I'm non-binary/GQ because it always requires some kind of explanation. Like what, can't they google it like a normal person? I feel like it's just polite to look it up privately. I mean, if there's questions after whatever, but I don't feel it's my responsibility to tell everyone what it means/is.

987,2487,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this. I've realized a few months ago that I'm probably gender queer, gender-fluid or nonbinary. I'm 23 and AFAB. I'm somehow worried (I think a lot of people are) of using the concept wrongly or appropriating it unlegitimately. I don't know if the feeling of discomfort that I feel towards femininity can actually be considered dysphoria. People around me are pretty open minded (I hang out around the polyam community a lot), so I can tell them about my questionning but I don't know many people I could talk to who actually relate. 

As a kid I've had some very feminine (barbie dolls and princesses) phases, and some phases where all my friends were boys and I wanted to be ""one of the boys"" really bad. I've always been more of an intellectual type, and way too bad at sports to be a tomboy in the usual sense. I'm also very small. My parents did not really discourage me from playing with either ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" toys even though they took for granted that I would like feminine things. (They did not disapprove me when I would wear boy's clothes that I borrowed from my friends occasionally). My mother works in a male dominated field and generaly has positions that are pretty much second-wave feminism. She used to be a bit transphobic (she understood that people might want to dress/behave like any gender they want but did not understand that people would want to modify their body to match that), but she has become more open minded now.

As a teenager, I had a looooot of internalized sexism. I would say that I was not like ""the other girls"" because girls are superficial or cause too much drama (which, as we know, is simply false). I simultaneously wanted boys to consider me one of their own while at the same time wanting them to be sexually/romantically interested in me, which could only happen if I looked feminine enough. So I dressed and looked relatively feminine. I sometime told myself "" I wish I were a man, but I could not become one with this body because I would be way too small and weak to be a man"".

As a young adult (or would that be ""late teens"" in English? like 17 to 20 yo), I've been in a long term abusive relationship with an extremely misogynistic guy. It was very hard to get over all the sexist ideas he had put in my head. I'm also a philosophy student, and philosophy has this tradition of being very male-centered, and I somehow related with that tradition. 

Then I started being interested in feminism, questioning gender roles and identifiying my own internalized sexism. I also became conscious that I was pansexual. I stopped trying to look interesting/attractive to men, because I grew more confident and was able to tell myself that people I was interested in had to be able to deal with who I am. I cut my hair short, I stopped shaving body hair, I started dressing more comfortable. 

Then I started questioning my gender identity. I feel uncomfortable (and maybe dysphoric) when people adress me too feminine compliments (such as telling me I'm pretty), when male partners (esp if they're straight) compliment my body. I feel most of the time uncomfortable about my breasts (I wear undersized sports bras to hide them) and very thankfull that they are not naturally too big. I feel a lot of height dysphoria. I feel small, weak and I feel that if I were to transition to masculinity, I would never pass. I compare myself to my male partners/friends a lot. When I talk to men (esp a group of men), I'm always very aware of how tall they are compared to me. I mostly wear men's clothes but they're always a bit too big and look ""borrowed"". I like when my girlfriend says I'm handsome or uses masculine pronouns (neutral pronouns are hard to use in French, I do use them but she doesn't know how to, and they definitely are not convenient). I don't think I actually want to be a man. I'm very aware that my socialization as a woman is a big part of who I am and I feel like I can't erase that (and don't really want to). I mostly want to be perceived as androgynous I think. Which is hard because I'm tiny. Some days I look at pictures of trans men and I wish I had a beard and a flat chest and other days I feel comfortable considering myself a queer woman and using she/her pronouns. I'm generally always uncomfortable about doing things that are perceived as girly, and I wonder if that's internalized sexism too (I do like these things on other people though). 

TL;DR (and conclusion): I'm worried that by calling myself genderqueer or gender-fluid, or wanting to use neutral pronouns, I'm just appropriating the struggles of people who struggle more than me, or that it's just a new ""post-feminist"" type of internalized sexism. I also don't know if my use of the word ""dysphoria"" is legitimate.

-Because I grew up in a religious environment my sexuality has been fairly suppressed throughout my life but as I?ve come out of religion I find clues about it through my turn on?s.

-In general I?ve found the whole ?sissy? genre to really resonate, though the term itself does not. I am submissive sexually and I guess sissy stuff would be a fetish, but I am unsure of how that squares with my gender identity on a more holistic level.

-I?ve called myself ?bi-flexible,? but I?ve only dated cis women.

-So far the only term that I?ve found that I resonated with was ?two spirit? but then I found out that you can only be that if you?re Native American and I?m not sure if I have any of that in my genes.

-I think I resonated with ?two spirit? because I am a very spiritual person (to provide some labels/terms: mysticism, non-duality) and feel like the complexity of my sexuality and gender expression and identity stems from my inner wholeness and Self which is actually more ?yin? than yang.

-My ideal partner would probably be a more dominant yang energy woman who would appreciate and celebrate me in my more yin/feminine expression and, at times, appearance.

-I can somewhat pass as being both male and female depending on the clothes I wear and how I present.

-Though I?m fairly new to exploring and questioning more about all this, I really relate to everything I?ve seen from Joseph Harwood in terms of expression, energy and appearance.

I'm wondering if anyone else here has experienced something similar? Is there some kind of explanation? So far, all I've come up with is that they have no idea how to approach me because they don't know what ""gender script"" to follow.

It feels almost like I don't exist - I'm not even standing there, even when their friend who is a woman is speaking directly to me. It's not a bother, as I don't care to be acknowledged by them. I just find the huge discrepancy btw how I'm treated as a woman and how I'm treated as a non-binary person by cisgender, white men so...surprising? But as I write this, I realize it's really not that surprising...",1,1543959206.0,a355c5,58,genderqueer
